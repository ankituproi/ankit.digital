We found that WooCommerce serves as the best no-cost wordpress ecommerce plugin. Throughout the research we decreased them down to eight , where Easy Digital Downloads(EDD) and Ecwid was just behind WooComeerce in ranking .Woocommerce is different and better because of its awesome integration tool and distinctive potential layout. EDD and Ecwid are also good as they have better tools for digital goods and the simplest looks for the beginners respectively.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exciting news about Wordpress eCommerce plugins their integration with a current Wordpress site.Thus if you own a blog and altogether want to merchandise or sell fruits online then you can do it with all the ease. We mainly concentrated on the free solutions as when you have a good free one why to pay for the same service?  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the existing sites the plugines merge with latest WordPress installs and also few of the reputable hosting companies provide you with an option of one-click ecommerce installs including WooCommerce.It is an easy process as just by installing the ecommerce plugin, blog owned by you or your business site suddenly increases its functionality to sell either digital or physical product.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are given some examples of a blog, nonprofit or business might be interested in selling:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any physical goods like ornaments, daily wears, or electronics.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital products like games, ebooks, latest entertainment facility.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Membership with a recurring payment.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web designing is also a part of business.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donation can also be accepted if you are a part of an NGO.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few factors affect our final decision but overview of the above is that WooCommerce is completely free to develop an online store, and market all surrounds the WooCommerce with where all sorts of extensions are being developed by the developers and also themes that merge with the plugin.The biggest reason to support this is that WooCommerce is open source that provides your user with the benefit of an open and active support community.</span></p><p>There are some other solutions present, and some individuals and companies may find them much more appropriate in certain cases.For example, if a company's whole sole focus is on selling digital good they might find some them more useful.Others might be really easy to install and setup and also manage on a simple blog, which makes it a healthy choice for beginners.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparison between WooCommerce and Ecwid is a great example. Even though the overall feature present in WooCommerce leaves Ecwid behind ,but you may choose Ecwid if your interest lies in merging with Weebly,Joomia or Wix as WooCommerce solely integrate with WordPress. Also if you are interested in selling only digital product then you might opt EDD even though WooCommerce supports selling of digital products.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solid set of extensions offered by EDD also supports physical products selling.But this is where it lags and sits in the second position as you might have to pay for the same extension. EDD provides you with everything be it discount or code or even data reporting. The main advantage will be the extension library provided by EDD.</span></p><p><b>How I came to Conclusion of the Best Free Wordpress Ecommerce Plugins</b></p><p><b>Now as I </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">have cleared that who must be considering an ecommerce plugin for WordPresss, accompanied by some of my own thoughts and opinions on the option ,I would like you  to lookk at the 3 tools I evaluated for the test:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy Digital Downloads</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecwid</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning I would like to put each plugin on an even field for playing. Yes, I have had experience with some of them in the past , others I never had any experience with.However , I started to compare between them thinking or rather imagining that I was a complete novice.This way i won’t be biased , and also it proved out to be a good choice as I was ready to look around and explore and also test some features as a person who wants to get as much information as it  is possible for a person to get.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start the comparison, I thought on 3- must have features to witness any solution that eventually got cut out. I also thought that I should evaluate the complete user-friendliness of these plug-ins, as this factor will affect greatly for maximum companies that demand an e-commerce plugin.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three important features of it are:</span></p><ul><li><b>It Should offer something to sell both physical as well as digital goods</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:-When witnessing physical products, the features are easier, as you're demanding product pages, taxes,shipping,or variants .Maximum of the plugins provide you this feature, I don’t matter if the physical product working is acquired through an extension as far as it does the trick.But in case of digital products this is the cause of majority of the system’s failure.The tools that you require are automated emails with download URLs , customer profiles for after downloading and also some restriction for  those downloads.</span></li></ul><ul><li><b>A simple cart for shopping- <span style="font-weight: 400;">It's pretty much my opinion that a shopping cart must also be beautiful.This is much of my opinion against yours.Although, we can discover few important items in a shopping cart that can create its beautiful and simple feature.The first and foremost area to check is where you are sent to checkout.All you will want is that a customer is not redirected to a third party that is it should be hosted on your own site. Even it is good to find a cart with just a few steps and short ,clean forms.The branding must be adaptive  as I don’t like to see any branding from the actual plugin companies because it is not their ecommerce site it belongs to you</span></b></li></ul><ul><li>For expansion of basic features ,extended library -<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reason behind my recommendation of Wordpress in just because of its open source community.This implies that you receive everything i.e from third party theme to plug ins that stretch the functionality of your site. The main functionality of WordPress plugins in they can be extended.As an example , you may be able to merge with a plugin for membership for recurring payments ,if you are interested in getting a way to get payments trhough complete different payment gateway.Note:When I was evaluating I never considered the WordPress plugin library as an extension library.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the basis of above three important features that free best ecommerce plugin must have , our list of plugins narrowed down to only three :</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EDD (Easy Digital Downloads)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecwid</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We left Cart66 Lite, Markerpress ,Jigoshop and WP Ecommerce as the plugine mentioned here are somewhere lagging behind in providing features helpful for business. Now we are left with three ecommerce plugins for selection.Now we will be discussing their features in more detail so to make the platform shine. However I would personally recommend any of the above thee mentioned ecommerce plugins to professionals or entrepreneurs but we will get into the details of the tools provided separately by all the three.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will be getting into a detail of the benefits provided by them to get the knowledge about which of the WordPress eCommerce platforms will lead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other features on the basis of which my further comparision laid its basis were:</span></p><ul><li><b>Merger with best credible payment gateways</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- payment gateways offering need two different things which are very important in every field : quality and quantity. Therefore, I went through all the payment gateways offered by each plugin and check to find if the offerings were actually of any good .Oftenly we come across many ecommerce platforms that choose either of the two or three default payment gateways . Personally I do not admire this quality as ever ecommerce platform should do their side of research as to find lowest price for own particular sales numbers.</span></li></ul><ul><li><b>Themes specially made for the plugin-<span style="font-weight: 400;"> WooCommerce is a very good example to support this statement .If you have selected a WordPress theme that is not particualaryly developed for the WooCommerce, you might face problems at the end or the product display and cart available for shopping would not be able to please the costumers.In this view , we wish to be ensured that somewhere we can locate online a developers for third party theme who already imagined a plugin during the creation of theme .</span></b></li></ul><ul><li>Capabilities of a user should be advanced-<span style="font-weight: 400;">THere might be some of your customers who would like to checkout with a guest account. But the ones who make you profit or commonly known as loyal ones would require a profile to save their wishlist and last few searches to be saved in their profiles .This make it easy for them to check the items and re download their digital products .It also becomes convenient for these customer to be able to view the estimated time for arrival and the shipping speed as well</span></li></ul><ul><li>Combination with different CMSs-<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the article is all about WordpPress plugins but this is where WooCommerce fails .Its not a major issue but few of the plugins enlisted above are much better for alternative content management systems.</span></li></ul><ul><li>Tools for marketing-<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The helpful feature of a marketing tool is that if a feature is not included in a plugin you can always switch to the extension library for checking and getting the item you require. This is why we consider an extension library important. Marketing tools can be from Facebook stores to sharing button of social media.</span></li></ul><ul><li>Tools related to membership and Subscription-<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a complete different set of features required if you are planning to set up a subscription or membership site.The tools related to above should be in your priority list while setting up the site related to membership and subscription. As there are companies available that provide membership or subscription as a secondary product .Due to this reason your whole and sole focus should be on the core product settings, payment gateways and tools for marketing . Content dripping is one area where one should focus while memberships.This method is quite similar to an online course where user comes to know or unveils the content during the progression of the site.</span></li></ul><ul><li>Customer Management must be powerful-<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The customer management is area where you fuel the way you target your customers and market based on their demands and this is the detail you get from customers history or categorizing out the type of people and the type of good they buy. In this way you can show your support . If you hmaintain a graph and spreadsheet then it is more likely for you to increase your conversion as you will know which customers buy two shirts per year . You can aim your customers with relevant mails to provide the with useful information this way . I personally like customer management as it also helps your user and customers. If someone reaches you for an information about recent purchase then its better that your system delivers the required details as soon as possible .</span></li></ul><p><b>Why WordPress Ecommerce Plug-in -WooCommerce is the best</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After keenly and deeply looking at all above-mentioned features, I consider WooCommerce worthy of being supreme.As stated above, you should not quickly come to the conclusion that WooCommerce is the plugin you require. Is it really safe if you have a blind faith and you take a dive in it? Yes . But should you rethink before making the decision regarding the type of selling you are into? Ofcourse yes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember we excluded the pricing before as all these three plugins are available for free but WooCommerce has most variant and helpful selection of themes and extensions as well all at a low price or can be available at free too . Several of the themes and plugins are provided or rather developed by the WooCommerce company but the rest are developed in all corners of the internet which provides you with a chance to develop a full online store without spending a penny from your own wallet</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above quantity and quality is all that matters and all eCommerce plugins have the extensions and themes but none stand a chance in front of WooCommerce.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lets have a deeper look in how WooCommerce deserved and fared in categories mentioned below:</span></p><ul><li><b>Combination with best credible payment gateways</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">-There are five pre installed payment gateways in WooCommerce plugin. The payments can be accepted via COD, bank transfers or cheque payments. You can also opt card payment via Simplify Commerce or PayPal.Small scale stores will work in these option available but I personally think that medium or large scale businesses might be needing more options.This is the reason WOooCommerce has both free as well as paid extension for further choices like Amazon Payments ,Authorize.Net etc.</span></li></ul><ul><li><b>Themes available specially for plugin-<span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you are finding an option for a theme built either by WooCommerce or a third party developer , Choices are becoming wider everyday.There is a wide range of themes available for example TeslaThemes ,Elegant theme or be it ThemeForest they all have one thing in common and it is none other than WooCommerce themes .You can also get large number of WooCommerce extensions on WordPress plugin.</span></b></li></ul><ul><li>Capabilities of a user are advanced-<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Users have the option of logging in =your site through WooCommerce and WordPress whereas many other capabilities of user are achieved with extension and the add-ons as well. For example with the help of extension one might handle wishlist and rewards programs on the other hand full user profiles can not be installed without extension’s support.</span></li></ul><ul><li>Tools for subscription and membership-<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything ranging from subscription to booking are available in the form of extensions.These extension can be at times costly but all of them are available in one time payment mode which implies it is easier to make money back rather than just few sales.</span></li></ul><ul><li>Strong customer management-<span style="font-weight: 400;"> With WooCommerce you can check your customer information by checking the customer history list. Within the plugin ,all the information punched by them in  your site is accessible to you which also include their address ,cell number ,email etc. The information regarding the payment detail are secured but e</span></li></ul><ul><li>Reporting is advanced- <span style="font-weight: 400;">It is all dependent on the way you wish your Wordpress dashboard to appear .According to my assumption ,many stores in their dashboards have a simple stats section which is solely possible via WooCommerce..Extra features are that all the sales reports are easily exportable from dashboard and shared with everyone working for your site of organization. Cost of all sold goods are covered in main reports and you can receive email alerts when generation of new sales takes place.</span></li></ul><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When compared to rest plugin comparisons, I found the right answers from my eCommerce WordPress search much faster.You will also find the power of WooCommerce when you start playing with it for a little time.But it is not over exaggerated when I say Easy Digital Download is so much good when we are in the field of Digital products on the site.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are still confused with the various options, I would suggest you take a look at CMS that you want to prefer. If you have a preexisting website other than WordPress then I would recommend you to switch to Ecwid before opting any other ones out there. If you are thinking of utilising WordPress, I would frankly recommend you to go and download the WooCOmmerce plugin right away and start enjoying it more.</span></p><p>Easy Digital Download is the only good choice you have when you are talking about digital or non physical goods for your site but personally again i would ask you to download the plugin on your own site and explore it and it's working as well.I am just presenting before you all the facts and features that you might consider before continuing with a plugin for your site .</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 24, 2020</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ankit.digital/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/thrive-landing-pages-and-content-builder-review-2017.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Thrive Landing Pages &amp; Content Builder Review 2017</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/fix-and-resolve-indexed-though-blocked-by-robotstxt.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Fix and Resolve - &quot;Indexed, though blocked by robots.txt&quot;</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ankit.digital/authors/ankit-sharma/" class="inverse" title="Ankit Sharma">Ankit Sharma</a></h3></div></div><div class="post__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankit.digital/connect-domain-name-to-your-ec2-instance-ip-address-wordpress.html" class="inverse">Connect domain name to your EC2 instance ip address (Wordpress)</a></h4><time datetime="2018-12-10T13:47">December 10, 2018</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankit.digital/find-htaccess-in-aws-linux-ami-wordpress-installation.html" class="inverse">Find .htaccess in AWS Linux AMI wordpress installation</a></h4><time datetime="2018-12-09T23:41">December 9, 2018</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankit.digital/step-by-step-guide-host-wordpress-on-amazon-linux-ami-ec2-instance.html" class="inverse">Step by Step Guide : Host Wordpress on Amazon Linux AMI EC2 Instance</a></h4><time datetime="2018-12-09T22:49">December 9, 2018</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://ankit.digital/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://ankit.digital/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=16be857f09f55a0c76ea5e92e1f5f9d0"></script></body></html>
