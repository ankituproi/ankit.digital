Well that you are here, I can tell you that you love the capability and the power of Mautic but you are not able to make optimum use of it due to either the lack of technical assistance and setup or due to the incompatibility of the Web hosting platform. <strong>I have been personally using Mautic for me and my clients for about 3 years</strong> now and have handled all the nitty gritty things about it. Web hosting is just one of them. I have listed my favourite web hosting solutions for hosting Mautic installation. These are the factors I used to review my best choices for Mautic hosting :</p><ul><li><strong><u>Loading Speed</u></strong> - Mautic is a heavy system and requires a fast optimised server to host it so as to avail good loading speed.</li><li><strong><u>Cron Jobs</u>&nbsp;</strong>- Not all web hosting will allow you to run the cron jobs the way you want them to run. Running cron jobs directly consume the server bandwidth and many web hostings (Specially shared one's doesn't allow them on complete autonomy )</li><li><strong><u>Support</u></strong> - As Every hosting environment is comprised of different technology and infrastructure. This might case few functionalities of Mautic not work for you. In such a scenario, hosting support must help you and resolve your issue.</li></ul><h2><a href="https://ankit.digital/recommends/kualo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Kualo Hosting</span></a></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(53, 52, 52);">Kualo is my favourite choice considering the quality of Support they provide and the Robust service they have.

Almost every web host provides <strong>Softaculous</strong> these days and that contains Mautic One Click installation service. But this doesn't necessarily mean that those Web hostings will let you operate Mautic installation in peace. Mautic in itself is a heavy tech infra demanding software which needs high quality server requirements that does not only host your Mautic installation with fast servers but also let you run all the important cron jobs.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I find <strong>Kualo</strong> as one of the highest reliable, cost friendly and support backed solution as a Mautic host. It has solved all the shortcomings mentioned above for me and I believe it should do the same for you.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><strong>WINNER</strong></span></em></p><p><span style="width: 100%;"><img class="lazyload" alt="" width="1200" height="627" title="company-rating" data-id="2580" src="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/18/responsive/company-rating-xs.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/18/responsive/company-rating-xs.png 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/18/responsive/company-rating-sm.png 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/18/responsive/company-rating-md.png 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/18/responsive/company-rating-lg.png 1024w" style="width: 100%;"></span></p><p>You can easily take their services hassle free.
