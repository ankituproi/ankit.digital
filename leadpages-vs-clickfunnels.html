In this review, we are taking a depth look at both of these marketing tools to help you which one is right for yours. In the world of marketing, there is no such thing as a “one size fits for all” tool. You can come into this review learning towards one but then you realize that the other one fits better.</p><p>We will look at both tools individually and then compare them together in a head to head match.</p><p>But before we discuss the tools let me explain the difference between a landing page and a funnel.</p><h2><strong>What is a Landing Page?</strong></h2><p>A landing page can be a page of your website that a new visitor lands first on that page. By definition, if we go then a landing page can be an email opt-in page, a sales page, your website’s homepage, a blog post, a product listing, or any other page on which you want to drive traffic.</p><p>In marketing, your goal is to create optimized landing pages for first-time visitors on your welcome page and help them to learn about your product or services. You may not make sales but you can collect email subscribers by offering lead forms or free ebooks or an email course.</p><h2><strong>What is Funnel?</strong></h2><p>The goal of your funnel may not be purchasing a product but it may be subscribing to your mailing list or signing up for a free trial. The ultimate goal is to make a sale but that is not mean that every funnel has to lead a sell.</p><p>You may also have several types of funnels on your site like:</p><ol><li>One that nurtures leads.</li><li>One that upsells your customers.</li><li>One that converts leads into your customers.</li></ol><p>Sales funnels are just a series of conversion-optimized pages.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img class="lazyload" loading="lazy" src="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/what-is-funnels-xs.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/what-is-funnels-xs.jpg 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/what-is-funnels-sm.jpg 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/what-is-funnels-md.jpg 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/what-is-funnels-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="what is funnels" width="723" height="427"></figure><h2><strong>What is ClickFunnels?</strong></h2><p>ClickFunnels is a marketing software that can help you to create conversion-optimized pages to use in your sales funnels.

It is quite easier than doing with self or manual customization.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img class="lazyload" loading="lazy" src="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/Drag-and-Drop-Customization-xs.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/Drag-and-Drop-Customization-xs.png 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/Drag-and-Drop-Customization-sm.png 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/Drag-and-Drop-Customization-md.png 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/36/responsive/Drag-and-Drop-Customization-lg.png 1024w" alt="Drag and Drop Customization with LeadPages" width="719" height="397"></figure><p><strong>Pre-Built Landing pages</strong></p><p>Leadpages also provides a number of pre-built landing page templates you just need to select the template you want to use and start the drag and drop customization in a very easy manner.</p><p><strong>Split testing for your landing pages</strong></p><p>With Leadpages you can do split testing for your landing pages and what you want to test about how much traffic you will get on that particular variant of the landing page.</p><p><strong>Lead Notifications</strong></p><p>If you have created a landing page but you have not connected any email marketing software then you don’t need to worry about your leads. You will get notified via your registered email id for your upcoming leads from your particular landing pages.</p><p>This is a great feature Leadpages comes with.</p><p><strong>SMS Sign-ups</strong></p><p>No one wants to see a lot of sign up forms for your lists. You should make it easy on them. Leadpages gives you the option to offer SMS sign up. With Leadpages you can send a text to their phone, they can respond to you with an email address. You will get this feature with LeadDigits which is one of the special features or addon by Leadpages.</p><p><strong>Easy to use opt-in Pop-ups</strong></p><p>As we all know about Pop-ups which are the proven method to capture leads. Use Leadboxes to create various types of opt-ins including your favorite pop-up or the exit intent. You can also use their WordPress plugin and embed these pop-ups on your blog posts outside the LeadPages.</p><p><strong>LeadDigits</strong></p><p>LeadDigits allows you to collect email leads through text message instead of asking people to visit on your website, just you need to ask them to text your LeadDigits number. Once they provide you their contact number they will get an automated text asking them to sign up to your email list. LeadDigits also offers an experience that will also improve your conversion rates. Because people will forget to look at your website.</p><h3><strong>Leadpages Integrations</strong></h3><p>Here is the list of all the integrations provided by Leadpages:</p><h4><strong>Email Integrations Supported by Leadpages</strong></h4><ul><li>1ShoppingCart</li><li>ActiveCampaign</li><li>AWeber</li><li>ConstantContact</li><li>Drip</li><li>Emma</li><li>GetResponse</li><li>GoToWebinar</li><li>Hubspot</li><li>iContact</li><li>InfusionSoft</li><li>Interspire</li><li>MadMimi</li><li>Marketo</li><li>MailChimp</li><li>OfficeAutoPilot</li><li>Salesforce</li><li>SendReach</li><li>WebinarJam</li></ul><h3><strong>Leadpages Support &amp; Community</strong></h3><p>Leadpages run various training webinars frequently with the aim of helping you to get more. Also, you can get more help from their active blogs, collection of marketing resources, and knowledge base. But they can’t provide chat on their site, chat feature is only available inside the Leadpage app for Pro and advanced members.</p><h3><strong>Pricing offered by Leadpages</strong></h3><p>Leadpages offered three-tiered pricing plans which are Standard, Pro, and advanced.</p><p>Also, you can choose a month to month billing for standard and Pro plan. The advanced plan requires an annual or two-year payment upfront. You will save quite a bit more if you will pay for annual and especially for a two-year service in which pricing is cut off in half as compared to monthly billing.</p><p><strong>Standard Plan</strong></p><p>In this plan, you have to pay $17 per month when you purchase two years upfront, $25 per month when you will purchase annually, and $37 for a month to month plan. Month to month is still in your budget if you will get such great features inside in comparison with ClickFunnels.</p><p><strong>Pro Plan</strong></p><p>In this plan, you need to pay $42 per month when you purchase for two years, $48 per month when you will purchase annually and $79 for a month to month plan.</p><p><strong>Advanced Plan</strong></p><p>This plan does not offer month to month plan. For annual billing you need to pay $199 per month and for two year purchase, you need to pay $159 per month.</p><h3><strong>ClickFunnels Vs. Leadpages</strong></h3><p>There a various factors that I personally believe most people will look at price and ease of use.</p><p>When you will see for price compatibility then Leadpages is the winner here. It is a bit cheaper than ClickFunnels.</p><p>There is a reason why Leadpages is much cheaper than ClickFunnels like Leadpages are not that much convenient than ClickFunnels.</p><p>You don’t need a separate web host or a seperate email marketing or shopping cart solution. Also you don’t need a seperate affiliate program. Everything is included in just one package.</p><p>If you are looking at this way then ClickFunnels is very budget friendly in its own right. But, I do think Leadpages is an awesome choice in some situations. If you want to create landing pages much quickly without more customization then Leadpages is a greap platform for you.</p><p>So, which should you choose?</p><p>Go with <span style="color: #236fa1;">Leadpages</span> if you want a budget marketing software that can get the job done. You can create beautiful sales pages without knowing a bit of codes.</p><p>Go with <span style="color: #236fa1;">ClickFunnels</span> if you want to create an effective conversion optimized funnel pages without learning HTML.</p><p>Go with <span style="color: #236fa1;">Leadpages</span> if you simply want to design landing pages with a simple one-step landing page.</p><p>Go with <span style="color: #236fa1;">ClickFunnels</span> if you don’t want to use different systems for marketing program. You will save much time with an all in one solution.</p><p>Go with <span style="color: #236fa1;">ClickFunnels</span>, if you want to create an funnel with multiple pages along with the flexibility to rearrange the pages in your funnel.</p><h6>Conclusion</h6><p>I love to use both ClickFunnels and Leadpages, and I think both are great tools for converting leads. You can only build pages on Leadpages but you can build pages and build funnels as well on ClickFunnels. The right choice for you will mainly depend on what you need from a marketing tool. But if you are still not confirmed about which one to use then you should try 14 days free trial of ClickFunnels and test all features. If you find that is not good for your business then cancel and check out Leadpages. I am about 90% sure that ClickFunnels will do everything you want.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 7, 2020</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ankit.digital/clickfunnels-reveiw/">ClickFunnels Reveiw</a></li><li><a href="https://ankit.digital/comparison-of-leadpages-vs-clickfunnels/">Comparison of LeadPages vs ClickFunnels</a></li><li><a href="https://ankit.digital/leadpages/">LeadPages</a></li><li><a href="https://ankit.digital/reviews/">Reviews</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fankit.digital%2Fleadpages-vs-clickfunnels.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://ankit.digital/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fankit.digital%2Fleadpages-vs-clickfunnels.html&amp;via=ankittheblogger&amp;text=LeadPages%20Vs%20ClickFunnels%3A%20The%20Ultimate%20Review" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://ankit.digital/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fankit.digital%2Fleadpages-vs-clickfunnels.html&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fankit.digital%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F36%2FLeadPages-Vs-ClickFunnels.png&amp;description=LeadPages%20Vs%20ClickFunnels%3A%20The%20Ultimate%20Review" class="js-share pinterest" title="[MISSING TRANSLATION] Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://ankit.digital/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Fankit.digital%2Fleadpages-vs-clickfunnels.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://ankit.digital/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fankit.digital%2Fleadpages-vs-clickfunnels.html&amp;title=LeadPages%20Vs%20ClickFunnels%3A%20The%20Ultimate%20Review" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://ankit.digital/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=LeadPages%20Vs%20ClickFunnels%3A%20The%20Ultimate%20Review&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fankit.digital%2Fleadpages-vs-clickfunnels.html" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://ankit.digital/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg></a></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/thrive-architect-vs-leadpages.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Thrive Architect Vs LeadPages: The Ultimate Review</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/thrive-themes-vs-clickfunnels.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Thrive Themes Vs ClickFunnels: The Ultimate Review</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ankit.digital/authors/vivek-mani/" class="inverse" title="Vivek Mani">Vivek Mani</a></h3><p>Vivek Mani is an SEO analyst.
