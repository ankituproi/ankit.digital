It's the key to Conversion.</p><p>A Digital Marketing Campaign is lifeless and unplanned without a Landing Page. Marketing is all about converting those targeted leads to lifelong potential customers. Without Landing page, your visitors might get confused about what to do next. Where to take the step? Where to see the details of what made them click on your ad?</p><p>Honestly, generic homepages can never serve your purpose of lead conversion. It needs a particular page that pinpoints all the specific consumer needs. That's how they will convert.</p><p>Unfortunately, a landing page doesn't build up on its own.</p><p>But, you don't need to run after the coders to design it from scratch.</p><p>Trust me, its pain.</p><p>So what to do?</p><p>The good thing is there are plenty of tools out there to make the whole process of creation &amp; management more comfortable for you, and you can create them in a fraction of time. A single landing page might not serve your purpose, for a successful campaign, you need to experiment with multiple designs and lead form placement within the landing page. So managing and optimizing your set of landing pages for better performance, it's pretty well become your full-time job until you have a single dashboard that helps you to optimize and manage effectively.</p><p>Landing page builders can save your precious time &amp; money as well.</p><p>{But before moving forward with the landing page builders, let's understand the difference between a landing page and a home page and why they are so important.</p><p>What is a Landing Page?}</p><p>As per updates in 2019, the market is full of excellent landing page builders. Here I am listing some for you which are catching the heart of all. Though each of these has its strengths and weakness, I will mention them all for you so that you can pick up the ultimate one to fulfill your business needs. Also, you can do better do A/B testing with the trial versions before picking the one.</p><h3>1. Elementor</h3><p>Starting with the best one which I have frequently been using.</p><p>Elementor is a WordPress plugin with the drag &amp; drop feature. It provides you a wholly original and separate interface for creating posts, custom post types pages. So when you open a standard format of creating posts or pages, you get a new button that allows you to enable the elementor, and then its a completely different and straightforward page editing process.</p><p>The best thing it can be done through a handy user interface, and you don't need to have any prior knowledge or skills about HTML or PHP. As it works on the frontend, it will show you the outcome right away so that you can visualize where it is going to stand. You can create any layout for your page regardless of what your current WordPress theme allows you to do. Also, it can quickly gel up with all the WordPress themes.</p><p>You can create impressive content structure and page layouts, even if you are not a designer or doesn't have site building coding skills. As per the latest report by elementor, they claim that their plugin has been downloaded for more than a million times.</p><p>If you are not willing to create a page from scratch, you can pick one from their pool of ready to use templates and tweak them a little to get your desired output.</p><h4>Pricing</h4><p>It's free. Hahahaha.</p><p>No, let's keep it real. Elementor offers an unlimited premium package, but honestly, you might not need it that much.  The main plugin is available in the official WordPress repository. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/">Here</a> is the link. You can install the plugin and get started immediately. There are no hidden costs.</p><p>Now talking about the pro-edition, there are some extremely cool features for the power users, and you can customize your CSS, work on your form straight from elementor, add slides, integrate woo-commerce, more content, more template blocks, etc. But it is not something which everyone needs so pick for yourself wisely.</p><p>The current pricing chart of Elementor,</p><figure class="wp-image-2567 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" src="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/16/responsive/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-8.34.59-AM-xs.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/16/responsive/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-8.34.59-AM-xs.png 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/16/responsive/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-8.34.59-AM-sm.png 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/16/responsive/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-8.34.59-AM-md.png 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/16/responsive/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-8.34.59-AM-lg.png 1024w" alt="elementor-pricing" width="800" height="600"></figure><h4>Pros &amp; Cons of Elementor</h4><ol><li> It have impressive features and is easy to use</li><li>It allows you to build custom pages</li></ol></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 24, 2020</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ankit.digital/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/best-webhosting-for-mautic-crm.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Best Webhosting for Mautic CRM</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/best-email-marketing-alternatives-to-mailchimp.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Best email marketing alternatives to Mailchimp</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ankit.digital/authors/ankit-sharma/" class="inverse" title="Ankit Sharma">Ankit Sharma</a></h3></div></div><div class="post__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankit.digital/thrive-landing-pages-and-content-builder-review-2017.html" class="inverse">Thrive Landing Pages &amp; Content Builder Review 2017</a></h4><time datetime="2017-01-19T07:02">January 19, 2017</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://ankit.digital/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://ankit.digital/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=16be857f09f55a0c76ea5e92e1f5f9d0"></script></body></html>
