As you all know there are a good number of online eCommerce platforms available for the beginners. But choosing the best one is a tough task as each one of them are good in providing one or the other functionality.</p><p>Does shopify really creates a website within minutes? Here in this shopify review I will be discussing all the pros, cons, features, and is it really better than the other giant ecommerce platforms available in the market. A lot of my people have asked me suggestion on e Commerce Platforms. One of my friend is interested in opening an online jewellry store of handmade jewelleries. So for her building a website is a hectic task for the beginning. So for her I did a research on what's the best available in the market. And most important why is it the best? So here I will mention the one I have started using recently.Â I will share all information in detail with facts, as my long answer might turn complicated for you.</p><p>I have examined 5 eCommerce platforms in depth and have reviewed all of them in article form on this blog. So its a fair war. Regarding shopify, I have been using it from 4 months now, selling my digital marketing services online. So let's move forward in detail on shopify.</p><h2><strong>What is Shopify?<br></strong></h2><p>Shopify is an online application that helps you to create an ecommerce online store. The main aim for creating shopify is to simplify the process for ecommerce beginners and helping them meet their branding requirements. Shopify provides a huge number of ecommerce templates that can be easily customised by the user. The user don't need to enter in the technicalities of designing and coding a website neither need to hire a web designing agency or a developer. However for people who know HTML and CSS, shopify provides you with both the features. You can customize the coding of the template to some extent.</p><p>The best part of using shopify is that you don't have to worry about buying a web hosting service or installing softwares on the server. Or I can say everything that you need to build and run your online store is being maintained out of your reach. So no need to worry about it. All you need is your product product and its pictures. Shopify quoted on their website that around 325,000 people are using shopify, and have generated a total of $24bn in sales.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 24, 2020</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ankit.digital/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/about.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">About</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/long-tail-pro-review.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Long Tail Pro Review</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ankit.digital/authors/ankit-sharma/" class="inverse" title="Ankit Sharma">Ankit Sharma</a></h3></div></div><div class="post__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankit.digital/best-email-marketing-alternatives-to-mailchimp.html" class="inverse">Best email marketing alternatives to Mailchimp</a></h4><time datetime="2020-04-14T14:45">April 14, 2020</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankit.digital/shopify-vs-woocommerce-which-one-should-be-preferred.html" class="inverse">Shopify vs WooCommerce: Which one should be preferred ?</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-14T11:54">August 14, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankit.digital/word-ai-review-or-honest-review-with-all-pros-and-cons.html" class="inverse">Word Ai Review | Honest Review with all Pros and Cons</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-13T09:32">August 13, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://ankit.digital/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://ankit.digital/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=16be857f09f55a0c76ea5e92e1f5f9d0"></script></body></html>
