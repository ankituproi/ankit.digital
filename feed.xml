I am doing email marketing for years and I have almost used all the top notch apps available in the market be it Mailchimp, Getresponse, Sendgrid, Mailgun, and many others. But there’s very strong feeling in you when you take control of your email marketing. On my hunt for perfect email marketing solution I got to know about Amazon SES. It’s part of AWS. With Amazon SES, you can widely operate not only for email marketing but also for various for marketing automation, triggering various kind of rules for emails and much more. Plus point of having this control is that you can do many things in cost efficient manner. With Amazon SES, your cost for sending 1000 emails is just $0.10.</p>

<p class="p1">Upside of using Amazon SES is just not being a cost efficient solution but also higher inbox delivery rates (Comm’on, we are talking about Amazon Servers).

<p class="p1">Now, this is where sendy comes in. You simply need to integrate Sendy with your Amazon SES account and then you are done. Post this, you will be able to setup email list creation for various of your sites, Subscription settings, create auto responders, Optin and Double Optin emails, and more.</p>

<li class="li1">Launch your campaigns and see detailed stats including, who open your emails, who clicked links inside your email. Mails that got bounced and people who unsubscribed will automatically be taken care with the help of the system. Next time when you send a campaign, these mail id’s would automatically be left out.

</li>
<li class="li1">Drip Series - Though this is not a proper if/else drip campaign functionality. But you can prepare your series of email for a particular set of subscribers. For example - You have launched your advertising campaigns to prepare an email list<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for people who wants to learn Blogging. As part of campaign you have asked your audience that they will receive 7 lessons for 7 days (1 lesson a day). So as soon as the person as subscribed, they will be able to receive a pre defined email as the course lesson everyday. You can design your own series of emails by Clicking on Autoresponder Tab inside your selected list. </li>
<li class="li1">Launch your email marketing agency : You can create sub-accounts with proper brand name and allot credits / limits to the sub accounts to send emails. This way, you can earn easy money selling out your email marketing services.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Conclusion / Takeaway - Given the price of Sendy, it is a versatile piece of software to handle your email marketing needs. This gives your the power to control your emails and the budget you spend on emails. I would rate sendy 5/5.</p>

<li><a href="https://ankit.digital/recommends/sendy">Sendy</a> - I have been using Sendy for around 2016. This is perfect if you already have a pre verified and double opt-in email list. I recommend you using this specially for sending newsletters. Sendy is a standalone app which can work with almost any smtp servers. Most recommend way of using sendy is to integrate it with <a href="https://www.editsoftdigital.com/amazon-ses-review/">Amazon SES</a>. It just costs $0.0001 per email sent. I see 90% inbox rate with detailed analytics of how my subscribers are performing.</li>
<li><a href="https://ankit.digital/recommends/sendfox">Sendfox</a> - Sendfox is a versatile app from Appsumo house. They don't sell it as SAAS for now. They sell it as a Lifetime Deal. You can outreach highly filtered email list through Sendfox. They have good inbox rate.</li>
<li><a href="https://ankit.digital/recommends/getgist">Getgist</a> - It is an email marketing automation platform. You can highly customise your email campaigns basis your subscriber behaviour on your already sent email, or on your website, landing page, etc. More than email marketing, they offer lead management, chatbot sequences, etc. They have their free tier program available.

                <p>There are various uncovered aspects of selling nutra products online. And I will uncover them all in this blog post. When it comes to promoting nutra products it is important to choose your promotion methods accurately and these methods are valid even if you are a seller or if you are the manufacturer. This blog post will also cover digital marketing for nutracuitical products and company.</p>
<p>I would be very precise and calculative in explaining my process based approach. Sales in ecom industry is a function of good process. So we have to implement all the digital marketing strategies in order to complement good process that can ultimately build unlimited sales funnel. Let's begin step by step.</p>
<h2>Digital Strategy to Sell Nutraceutical products with digital marketing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Building an online E Com Store is very important if you want to have good sales without being dependent on third party platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and others. We recommend building this store using Shopify due to the responsive features of shopify and having it's adaptability in scaling the store as much as we wish to. <strong>We are shopify partners in India and so we can also help in store building part</strong>, if not developed already.</li>
<li>Influencers Outreach. To have better marketing of our products via social media and other mediums, we need to reach out to influencers and experts in the industry and collaborate with them to promote our products. These influencers can be - <strong>Health Experts | Health Bloggers | Food Bloggers | Gym Trainers | Nutritionist | Fitness Freaks and many more</strong>.</li>
<li>Influencer outreach program can be further categorised in two models - <strong>Pay Per Post</strong> and <strong>Become an Affiliate.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Launch Giveaway : </strong>To increase the organic reach for our products, we can introduce weekly giveaway of our products. These giveaway's shall have certain rules that will directly impact the virality of our products. You can have a look at one of the good case study of Kingsumo. <a href="https://sumo.com/stories/viral-giveaways" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sumo.com/stories/viral-giveaways</a> . We use Kingsumo to create viral giveaway's .</li>
<li>Promote and Run ads around multiple lead magnets. There are various lead magnets including - Ebook | Health Guide | Checklist | How to PDF's and so on. Let me put an example here. Here's an E Book on "<strong>Nutrition as a part of Therapy in the treatment of Liver Disease</strong>" . Now this Ebook will have useful content for the patient that shall include our products. Also, we run ads around this lead magnet to promote it and then build our sustainable email list. Two benefits we got - We sent out our product promotion to the prospect in terms of e book and we also have the prospect's email address.</li>
<li>These lead magnets can be promoted FB, Insta, Google, Native Ads, Pinterest, Youtube Videos. This promotion can be organic and paid.</li>
<li><strong>Launch Drip campaigns around email lists</strong> build from lead magnets. For example. In the above case, lead magnet was the ebook for Liver patients. So we have prospects to whom we can always followup regarding our products related to Liver. Or we can ask them to schedule a free appointment with our Nutritionist for better understanding on improving liver problems. Such drip campaigns focuses on sending series of emails on various parameters. These parameters can be Last email open or not, E Book downloaded or not, visited our landing page or not, Abandoned cart or not. Below  drip chart is an example of drip email series. We use our in-house built app called <strong><a href="http://sell3x.com">Sell3x</a></strong> to perform email marketing automation.  Here's an example of a drip email campaign. <figure class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2549"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-md.jpeg 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-lg.jpeg 1024w"  alt="" width="771" height="658"></figure></li>
<li>Let us say we have got 1000 email subscribers from our lead magnet - <strong>Nutrition as a part of Therapy in the treatment of Liver Disease. </strong>Now we send out email campaigns as a drip series. Each email shall contain a link back to our landing page or store. This will have two impact - <strong>Sales or No sales</strong> from our E Com Store. If it's a sale, very good. If it's not a sale, we will put all this audience who clicked on the link and visited on our landing page on Facebook and Google re-marketing ad funnel. This ad funnel shall show ads to audience claiming 25% flat off on their first purchase.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Email Marketing</strong> </span>- Email marketing needs to be done for various process.- Asking Gym Trainers, Celebrities, Influencers, Food Bloggers, Nutritionist and others to join our Affiliate program and our outreach program.- Reaching out our prospects through email lists.- Emailing existing customers to buy again.The entire strategy will not be focused on just one marketing channel. We will leave no DM channel unturned and employ all the strategies in parallel so as to have aggressive promotion and sales in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Remarketing Campaigns</strong> - There's a saying in internet marketing that it takes 7 attempts for a visitor to convert into a customer. This means that you have to get into the eyes of a prospect atleast 7 times so that he could make a decision. Re-marketing comes in here. We do this with the help of Facebook and Google Ads. If some one has visited your website once, you can make him visit your landing page / website / lead magnet or anything related by re-marketing him.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Concluding Notes</strong> -  </h3>
<p>Digital Sales is a function of a optimised digital marketing process. And we at Editsoft Digital are highly inclined towards building the same process.</p>
<p>Digital marketing is all about how creative you can be. And when it comes to be innovative about your approach, I am cent percent sure about how my team would execute the plan perfectly. So, in the end it matters about the execution only. There are a lot of places available over internet to find about new plans, ideas and promotional methods but the thing that owns the result is just the execution. Thus, my suggestion to have full focus on the implementation part and then take your project ahead.</p>

                    <img src="https://ankit.digital/media/posts/23/long-tail-pro-review.png" alt="Long Tail Pro Review" />
                <p>If you are searching for the best keyword research tool to grow your business online then I assume that you already know the basic of how to do keyword research and importance of doing keyword research. Searching for the best list of keywords which have low competition and high amount of searches isn't difficult if you have chosen the right tool to find the keywords.</p>
<p>So today we will be investigating about this tool: Long Tail Pro keyword research tool. How effective is it to find the best suitable keyword for your niche? What's different in it? How effective is it to automate your keyword Research? We will also do the comparison between LongTail Pro and other specialized keyword research tool in terms of their features and functionality.</p>
<p>But first, let me tell you more about me. And why I am making bold statements about Long Tail Pro Review.</p>
<p>I am in the blogging field from 3 years now and have learned everything by experimenting on my blogs. I have used many keyword research tool in the first year of my blogging journey and became constant with Long Tail Pro from 2 years now and will continue to do so. Keyword Research is the beginning, if you are doing SEO of your article and targeting the right keyword can be a game changing for your blog. So keywords must be chosen wisely.</p>
<h2>Long Tail Pro Review</h2>
<p>Before going deep in the investigation of Long Tail Pro first we need to know what is Long Tail Pro</p>
<h2>What is LongTail Pro?</h2>
<p>Long Tail Pro is compelling keyword research tool which assists the user to choose a Longtail Keyword. It generates a list of thousands of possible long tail keywords within minutes from a single root keyword or multiple root keyword. It started as an adobe air based application and now it is available as a cloud-based application online.</p>
<p>It fetches the data from google keyword tool to pull all the keyword data related to a specific set of keywords that user wishing to analyse. With a root keyword, you can generate a huge list of all the relevant keywords along with their monthly search volume, Cost Per Click, competition level with advertiser &amp; Long tail keywords. The metrics for long tail keywords is only available for platinum users.</p>
<p>So Long Tail pro allows generating a huge list of all possible long tail keywords from a single root keyword or multiple seed keyword, quickly, effectively and efficiently. With this list of keywords, you can analyse the each on the basis of their search volume, CPC, competition level and select a small list of keywords that are good to include in your content or Pay Per Click Campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Unique Feature:</strong> The keyword competition metric of Long Tail Pro is a unique and best feature which decide the difficulty level of the keyword.</p>
<h3><strong>How keyword competition metric calculated? </strong></h3>
<p>So let's go in deep of how and on what basis it analyse the keywords. Long Tail Pro inspect the first 10 display searches of the root keyword and applying its calculations with the metrics like Page Link, Domain Authority, Page Rank, Site Age, Moz rank, Juicing Page, URL, and Title. After calculation, it displays the competitiveness of the keyword ranging from 0-100. The keyword at the first position is the easiest to rank while the one at the last is the highly competitive keyword.</p>
<p><strong>Good competition score: </strong>If you have a new website, it's good to target keywords with competition score less than 25 and up to 40 for the already established site.</p>
<h3>Is it the only tool with Keyword competition Metric?</h3>
<p>So as I have mentioned earlier that the unique feature of Long tail Pro is Keyword Competition Metrics but Long tail pro is not the only keyword research tool who has it's own competition metrics. Moz had developed its own competition metrics which is named as "keyword difficulty". It's a percentage based metrics as it measures the competitiveness of the keyword in %, the higher the percentage - the more it is difficult to rank for.</p>
<p>If we compare both the tools Moz and Long Tail pro on basis of keyword competition metrics, as per my experience I'd say Long Tail Pro is much more reliable as the comparison to Moz. However, we can't review the keyword research tool on the basis of competition metrics only. To give an objective review I will dig deeper into the usability of this tool.</p>
<p>So Long tail pro can be categorised in 3 core categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keyword Research</li>
<li>Rank Checker</li>
<li>Competitor analysis</li>
</ol>
<h2>Long Tail Pro Keyword Research Feature:</h2>
<p>As we have already discussed a glimpse of how this keyword research feature of Long tail pro works. You just need to add one or more seed keyword and click on generate results. It will showcase all the possible long tail keywords related to the seed keyword. But there is much more than this in Long tail Pro. They are other different advanced features that you can use, such as importing a list of seed keywords from an external source. Also, you can filter the results on basis of no. of words in a query, cost per click &amp; no. of searches.</p>
<p>Once you have clicked the generate button, Long Tail Pro usually takes 1-3 minutes to load the result with the list of keywords. The result loading speed depends upon the type of the seed keyword you have entered and the scale of the result list. After the resulting load up, it displays a nicely laid out version of Google Keyword Planner. The difference between two is that you need a monthly subscription of Long tail Pro to calculate competitive metrics of each keyword.</p>
<p>To conclude this feature of Long Tail Pro: a nicely laid sorted design with the ability to delete irrelevant keywords and add relevant keywords to your favourite tab, these feature a similar to that of google keyword planner. So here I don't see any huge advantage of spending $$$ on Long Tail pro monthly subscription.</p>
<p>However, Long Tail pro offers a unique feature as 'keyword competitor' metric and this is the biggest advantage of using long tail pro but as it is not available for all the users of Long Tail Pro. I will rate this feature 5 out of 10.</p>
<p><strong>Personal rating: 5/10 </strong></p>
<h2>Long Tail Pro Competitor Analysis Feature:</h2>
<p>Competitor analysis of long tail pro is for sure a better feature to count on. It allows you to analyse the first ten results on google with that individual keyword. LTP calculates the competitiveness of the keyword by analysing the results on the basis of  9 data points:</p>
<ul>
<li>PA ( Page Authority)</li>
<li>PL ( Page Links)</li>
<li>DA ( Domain Authority )</li>
<li>Moz Rank</li>
<li>Site Age</li>
<li>PR ( Page Rank )</li>
<li>Juicing Page</li>
<li>URL</li>
<li>Title</li>
</ul>
<p>Above data points are very important and useful in considering the competitiveness of the keyword. Long Tail Pro uses these feature to analyse and the results are laid out in a table structure which is easy to understand by a user.</p>
<p>Considering only this feature isn't unique as there are many others keyword research tools offering the same. But, if you have purchased the monthly subscription you can gain the benefits of keyword competition metric for the keyword you are analysing.</p>
<p>For this tool to be of any significant the competitor analysis tool must have keyword competition metric. Without the keyword competition metrics, the competitor analysis metrics is not simply useful enough. Though its time saving but keyword competition metrics makes it much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Rating: 6/10</strong></p>
<p>Now let's discuss the last feature of Long Tail Pro which is the Rank Checker. For the people who have the understanding of Search engine Optimisation (SEO) must be familiar with this term. Having a tool which can check the ranking's on the website with a targeted keyword and that too on daily basis is pivotal. Well, Long Tail will take care of this feature.</p>
<h2>Long Tail Pro Rank Checker Feature:</h2>
<p>If you guys are familiar with rank checking tools or used one before. You must be clear that there are several other rank checking tools available in the market. So what makes Long Tail pro special in this feature? The rank checking feature of long tail pro is inbuilt which makes it handy to use.</p>
<p>You can simply add the keyword and the domain URL and set the country you wish to target. Click on check rank to see the results. Long Tail Pro will compile the results on the basis of your preferences and you will see the position number on google, yahoo and bing.</p>
<p>So basically it's a very simple feature and is an important and useful one. So simple addition of this feature in long tail pro is a good offering. It obviously good to have one tool which provides you with the features of many other marketing tools.</p>
<p><strong>Personal rating: 8/10 </strong></p>
<p>So far we have discussed the 3 core categories or I should better say core features of Long tail Pro. I have mentioned all that I have examined with my experience and I hope my personal ratings to these features will be help for you to understand the Long Tail pro features. So what mostly we have discussed is the good part of Long Tail Pro. But I would like to share some of the issues I faced while using a Long tail pro to make the picture clear of how it is.</p>
<h2>Long Tail Pro Issues:</h2>
<p>Well! I might go blunt here sharing my experience. I have been using Long Tail pro from two years now and I haven't seen any update that actually had any changes to its functionality or interface. Also, the biggest problem I experience is it's the inability to consistently bring back the data. And this happens to me frequently and I haven't found any solution to this problem.</p>
<p>Though I had a back to back email conversation with the long tail pro team but still I face the similar issue. When I create a new campaign and try to use the pre-establishes dataset with the new seed keyword, the keyword analysis feature pop up with a load box but nothing happens, it just keeps on loading.</p>
<p>This is the biggest problem I face in using Long Tail Pro and to be very honest, this is really frustrating for me sometimes. To be honest, there is no other problem there in using Long Tail pro. Though there are some features which can be added to Long Tail pro but I won't be discussing them here.</p>
<p>Well! there are many things in life which aren't perfect actually nobody and nothing is perfect. But for sure Long Tail Pro is the best tool for doing keyword research</p>
<p>So far I have discussed the main features of Long tail pro and the issues I have experienced. Now I will discuss who is the intended user of Long Til pro and I will tell you if its a go for you or the bad in giving it a chance.</p>
<h2>Who should purchase the Long Tail Pro?</h2>
<p>If you have an established website and searching for the content keywords ideas to drive more traffic to your website then definitely you can give a try to long tail pro as it will provide you with the keywords to work on and rank the website on those keywords.</p>
<p>If you don't have a website but still murmuring the idea and planning to create one. Why don't you try entering some seed keywords and see what it give you.</p>
<p>If you are not sure where to start with, think about the topics that interest you and the things that you are passionate about, products and news you recently interacted with. Collect some seed keywords from them and click go. Might be you get the right idea to work on.</p>
<p>In case you are an advertiser, Long tail pro can really be helpful for you to collect all the dataset of the keywords together so that you can put a bid on the right keywords.</p>
<p>So basically if you are spending a significant amount for doing keyword research using Google Keyword Planner, or if you haven't started using one. I will suggest you go with Long Tail Pro.</p>
<h2><strong>Pricing : </strong></h2>
<p>Long Tail Pro offers plans for 3 categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starter Plan: In this, you can search for 10,000 keywords per month.<br> Monthly subscription is of $37 per month<br> Yearly subscription will cost cheaper as $25 per month</li>
<li> Pro Plan:  With this, you can search for 25,000 keywords per month<br> Monthly subscription is of $67 per month<br> Yearly subscription will cost cheaper as $45 per month</li>
<li> Agency Plan: With this, you can search up to 60,000 keywords per month<br> Monthly subscription is of $147 per month<br> Yearly subscription will cost cheaper as $98 per month</li>
</ol>
<p>The trial version of all 3 plans costs only <strong>$1 for 7 days.</strong> I will suggest you opt for trial version first, as it is cheap and you can yourself judge how effective it is.</p>
<p>After dicussing alot about Long Tail pro and its features, Here I am summing up all its pro's and con's to make you learn about it.</p>
<h2>Pros and Con's of Long Tail Pro:</h2>
<p>Long Tail Pro was rated as the best keyword research tool by the industry experts and is used by more than 1 Lac digital marketers all around the world. It's very effective in finding the low competitive keyword in the most competitive niches. Also providing a detailed report of SEO metrics to analyze and filter the keywords to use. But just like any other thing it also have its flaws. So let's have a look at the pro's and con's of using Long Tail Pro</p>
<p><strong>Pro's </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time filtration: It filters keywords and show results by no. of words, cost per click, local searches, keyword competitiveness and the level of advertiser competition.</li>
<li>Calculate keyword profitability: It uses the Rank Value feature to determine the keyword profitability</li>
<li>10x faster than desktop version: The Long Tail pro cloud is much faster than the adobe air desktop version.</li>
<li>Keyword Competitiveness Metrics: As described earlier, this is the best feature of Long tail Pro.</li>
<li>Custom Targets: Long Tail Pro tool calculates keywords competitiveness you should target on the basis of your own domain metrics.</li>
<li>Majestic SEO data Integration</li>
<li>Exports Results: You can export the list of keywords, metrics data, google top 10 results etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Con's </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Still needs more minutes to calculate in bulk for an extra large set of keywords.</li>
<li>The Rank Value metrics it shows isn't definite.</li>
<li>It cannot easily segment results for individual root keywords.</li>
<li>There are few noticeable bugs in the cloud version in comparison to the desktop version.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reviews by Industry experts:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"I’m a fan of Long Tail Pro! It’s a powerful keyword research tool that I’ve used and am very impressed. I definitely recommend Long Tail Pro. It’s a must-have tool for any SEO or Internet Marketer."<br> Pat Flynn – SmartPassiveIncome.com</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Alternatives to Long Tail Pro:</h2>
<p>As I mentioned the prices earlier, the trial version of Long Tail Pro is cheap enough to give it a try and I think you should. In the trial period, your can test and judge the tool yourself.</p>
<p>Moving forward towards the alternatives, there are several other keyword research tool in the market and almost each of them comes with a trial version. So you can give a try to them as there is no tool which does everything.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Moz </strong><br> Moz offers a 30 days trial version after filling the credit card. Though it reminds you few days before the tril completes.<br> Moz actually doesn't work as a keyword research tool but you can pair it up with Long Tail pro or Google Keyword planner to find the competitiveness of the keyword, analyzing the top results and the competition websites. And doing this you can finally track down rankings of targeted keywords.</li>
<li><strong>SEM Rush<br> </strong>Sem rush offers a 14days trial. The pro version is of $69.5 per month and then there is a guru and business plan which are very costly.<br> Its a great tool for keyword analysis and competitor analysis but similar to Moz it doesn't provide the list of additional keywords related to your seed keyword.</li>
<li><strong>Authority metrics<br> </strong>This one is new in the keyword research tool market and is very similar to Long Tail pro. Created by some guys from No hat digital Authority Metrics is definitely worth looking at. They offer 30 days money back guarantee, so you have plenty of time to review this keyword research tool.</li>
<li><strong>Google Keyword Planner<br> </strong>Duuhh!! List can be completed without google keyword planner. It is alpha &amp; omega of keyword research tools. and its free to use But you must have an Adwords account to login in the Google keyword planner. It will show you results like the Average Monthly Searches, competition level of the keyword(Med, High, Low), and the cost per click (bid) on the targeted keyword. But there is a small problem. A recent change in keyword planner range the monthly searches in 7 volume sizes  0–10, 10–100, 100–1000, 1000–10000, 10000–100k, 100k–1MM and 1MM+. So we can see the huge swings in the min-max search volume and the accurate searches are available for only those who are high paying ad buyers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though I am recommending the alternatives but I am not using any of them. Sound silly to me.</p>
<p>Well I am using long Tail Pro, ahrefs, SEMRush and sometimes I also use Google Keyword Planner. Actually, I use them all together, combine their results to analyze the Search Engine Page Result to understand the overall market place.</p>
<p>So I think it's time to wrap it up. I would conclude by saying that I really enjoy using Long tail pro and I am a big fan of its keyword competition metric. It had helped me to filter the thousands of useless keyword and still doing them same today. I think its the most affordable keyword research tool available in the markets with great features like keyword competition metrics, so I will recommend using Long tail pro.</p>
<p>Though I will not recommend it purchasing without the Keyword competition metrics as I don't find it simply amazing without keyword competition metric and it wouldn't benefit you much.</p>
<p> </p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce vs Shopify- To put it in simple words these two are the most popular of all the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-Commerce platforms present in the market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It completely depends on your needs as each one available here can be probably the only solution for you to build your ecommerce store or to with . And the news you would like to know right now is that you can accomplish it at your own without any outside help of a proffessional designer .We’ll be discussing it later .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There might be many questions or you might be wondering ton things like which one should I opt for? Which is going to fit in my specific needs better is it shopify or WooCommerce of course we are here talking about developing an online shop.Which has more features?Which one is costlier? Flexibility .. features provided by both of them .. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know this is lot to take in at single time ,but as me proceed further you might get answers to all of the questions mentioned above and all of them in  depth .You will unveil the one platform you want according to your needs and requirements of your e-Commerce store.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shopify vs WooCommerce</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.)</span><strong>Design:-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design is whole sole of the eCommerce store. Site is not trusted by users until it functions well and has right aesthetics as well.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shopify’s Design-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality of visual themes provided by Shopify are its best selling points.The templates available for you on shopify are more than hundreds and more than twenty of them are available in free . All of them available on Shopify are mobile responsive which is its best part and varying color options are available as well.Aesthetics of these templates are clean and are fashionable sleek which makes it well suited for modern thinking websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Templates provided by shopify are designed by creative outsourced web designers. Since it is not a in house creation they are ensured to be up to date and very engaging .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the pricing for some of the templates might go as high as two hundred dollars per template but after spending you will feel the template worthy of the price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t panic as I mentioned above there are wide variety of free options available as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Shopify’s attractive designs catches many eyes and in result sometimes users who used Shopify to create their webpage complain of its similarity with other sites. So Shopify also provides you with easy methods of chopping and changing .This is the reason behind the encouragement of customization.You can change the style or color or both with ease ,where on the other hand many proffessional designers can use the specialized ‘Liquid’ Language of this platform to make it creative and completely seperate a brand’s look .</span></p>
<p><strong>WooCommerce Design-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many different features of WooCommerce when we come to talk about its designs ,then you have to invest some hours and will discover that world is your oyster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers of WooThemes created the WooCommerce plugin and is acquired by Automattic. It is not the platform for delivery of particular design traits . It just offers you the way to sell products or a service online . The designing part is dependent on the WordPress theme you have currently .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore it can be said that WooCommerce is created to cooperate with varying themes in the market but condition applied is they should follow standard recommendations and hours of practice.It implies that in maximum cases you can choose any WordPress theme according to your choice and integrate it with WooCommerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provided with the above mentioned themes you can also find some themes specially built for WooCommerce to create your service or product option list look eye catchy.Woo’s default theme called Storefront which is available for free , is the best design to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is creative theme which was designed by keeping all the features of an efficient eCommerce store in mind and in result help you sell your product with ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are child themes for Storefront also available for those who want to modify the look of their store further. Some of the themes are also available in variety of range i.e from as low as 39$ per piece and can go only high up to 120$. But as it is said ‘Money well spent’ or worthy of the price tag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a wide range of WooCommerce themes ,you can always switch to ThemeForest where WooCommerce compatible themes are available in hundreds in number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When comparison has its basis on design ,definitely WooCommerce stands way ahead of SHopify .It is clear from above stated fact that apart from WooCommerce themes , you can also use any of the WordPress themes to work with your platform and definitely you can find hundreds of thousands of them on web.</span></p>
<p><strong>2.)Comparison on Money basis (Price)-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two really  have very different approach towards pricing. And under this basis Shopify wins as its pricing strategy is quite clear and straightforward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce although being available for free or in one word said as open source software. It is easily downloadable from WordPress.org in free atleast but once you go for actually launching an eCommerce working store you should ready with your wallets to spend some penny for it.(You’ll unveils the details in a while)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it in simple words ,when you work with Shopify, you can relate it to single out of the box solution available with a one time price tag . Once you open the box , you are good to go with the latest new eCommerce store since all your requirements are included in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summing up the above mentioned details we can conclude it into :</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce store by Shopify implementing a top level domain :29.75$ per month.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce store by WooCommerce implementing on same setup:$29 per month .</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce claims to be available at free of cost and although its software is available at free of cost but if you want to run your Ecommerce store it costs approximately same as Shopify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expenditures on WooCommerce do not end up just here as you have to also spend some from your wallet on SEO,Payment gateways and many more features. These extensions may be all one time payment but are usually around $49-$79</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final line of all above discussion is WooCommerce is comparatively cheaper but with every extended features you have to exchange dollars .You have to be careful while setting up that you dont go over your budget line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also transaction fees to explain this further, whenever anything from your site sells i.e for processing payment or delivering money to your account they charge you money. Usually it is around 3-4% per transaction and it changes quite often but confirm the details before signing up a deal with either of these platforms .</span></p>
<p><strong>3.) Comparison of the basis of Features:-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although both platforms have completely different point of view towards pricing but when it comes to features, the are both approximately similar.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shopify-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify presents you with lots of free options, from the very beginning it allows you to have :</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Products are unlimited</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage of file is unlimited</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud analysis is automatic</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog modules</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discount codes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSL certificate is absolutely free</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML and CSS are purely editable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments through credit card</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varying language options</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profiles of customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media combination</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both physical as well as digital products in store</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic is unlimited</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup regular</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site stat and report of product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Print orders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipping options</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As compared to WooCOmmerce where feature as shipping options, CSV uploads or fb selling will set you back up to five hundred to six hundred dollars to even get started Shopify provides all these completely free of cost.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shopify:-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a complete out-of-the-box solution and subsciption based.It can be used both online and offline as well. It also provides you with 24*7 chat and email support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your store can be modified to an extent allowed by Shopify i.e it is a closed platform and it also controls your web data. The designs made available to you are in hundreds in number out of which more than twenty are available at totally free of cost. They make you available with free domain with every plan. File storage is also unlimited It also has a native support for various languages.</span></p>
<p><strong>WooCommerce:-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a plugin by Wordpress which is absolutely free. All it needs to get started is a server and WordPress working installation to run.It only works online and has ticket as well as forum support. Different from Shopify ,it is an open source which in simple words implies you can freely modify your store without any boundations. Unlike Shopify the subdomain is not included within it and also the storage of file is limited. It also accepts various different languages via third party plugins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it is evident from above mentioned comparison that none of the important features are missing from either of the platforms. While choosing one platform all you need to concentrate on, is your personal need or your need of an open or close platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally while evaluating both platforms on the basis of their features I somewhere felt that Shopify was a little ahead of WooCommerce as Shopify is laser-focused solution and easy to handle as well. But on the other hand WooCommerce is extremely feature rich. We can conclude that winner on the basis of features can not be decided as they both have their equal positives and negatives as well . All depends on your and your site’s personal need .</span></p>
<p><strong>4.) Usability (ease)-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So according to above points we didn’t have our winners so maybe this is a point where we can compare them . The point states the ease with which a working eCommerce store can be setup by using any of them.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shopify-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well in my personal opinion, when it comes to an ease with which you can set up shopify’s strength lies within this. Since it is a subscription based tool, which if simply put in words implies that you just have to visit Shopify.com and sign up. Go through their process of setup and you are all good to go </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very user friendly and guides you all the way by helping you setup via asking you type of your store and relatively suggesting you a type of design well suited for your store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t require any professional skills to develop your site. The process is itself very straightforward. All the important features of it can be accessed later, just after you have your store running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify is an intuitive solution and there are no unexpected interruption . which means you can simply set up your store just by signing-in.</span></p>
