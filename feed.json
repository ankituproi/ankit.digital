I am doing email marketing for years and I have almost used all the top notch apps available in the market be it Mailchimp, Getresponse, Sendgrid, Mailgun, and many others. But there’s very strong feeling in you when you take control of your email marketing. On my hunt for perfect email marketing solution I got to know about Amazon SES. It’s part of AWS. With Amazon SES, you can widely operate not only for email marketing but also for various for marketing automation, triggering various kind of rules for emails and much more. Plus point of having this control is that you can do many things in cost efficient manner. With Amazon SES, your cost for sending 1000 emails is just $0.10.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Upside of using Amazon SES is just not being a cost efficient solution but also higher inbox delivery rates (Comm’on, we are talking about Amazon Servers).

To do that, you need to either code your own application or fins some reliable hosted app that can act as your email client.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now, this is where sendy comes in. You simply need to integrate Sendy with your Amazon SES account and then you are done. Post this, you will be able to setup email list creation for various of your sites, Subscription settings, create auto responders, Optin and Double Optin emails, and more.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://blog.ankit.digital/recommends/sendy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sendy - Email Marketing Tool</a> : Detailed Review with Pros and Cons</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">As clear from my post, you might be of this opinion that this guy is just talking of the positive aspect only and thus you are somehow missing our review of Sendy.

For example - You have launched your advertising campaigns to prepare an email list<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>for people who wants to learn Blogging. As part of campaign you have asked your audience that they will receive 7 lessons for 7 days (1 lesson a day).

            "content_html": "<p>There are various uncovered aspects of selling nutra products online. And I will uncover them all in this blog post. When it comes to promoting nutra products it is important to choose your promotion methods accurately and these methods are valid even if you are a seller or if you are the manufacturer. This blog post will also cover digital marketing for nutracuitical products and company.</p>\n<p>I would be very precise and calculative in explaining my process based approach. Sales in ecom industry is a function of good process. So we have to implement all the digital marketing strategies in order to complement good process that can ultimately build unlimited sales funnel. Let's begin step by step.</p>\n<h2>Digital Strategy to Sell Nutraceutical products with digital marketing</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Building an online E Com Store is very important if you want to have good sales without being dependent on third party platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and others. We recommend building this store using Shopify due to the responsive features of shopify and having it's adaptability in scaling the store as much as we wish to. <strong>We are shopify partners in India and so we can also help in store building part</strong>, if not developed already.</li>\n<li>Influencers Outreach. To have better marketing of our products via social media and other mediums, we need to reach out to influencers and experts in the industry and collaborate with them to promote our products. These influencers can be - <strong>Health Experts | Health Bloggers | Food Bloggers | Gym Trainers | Nutritionist | Fitness Freaks and many more</strong>.</li>\n<li>Influencer outreach program can be further categorised in two models - <strong>Pay Per Post</strong> and <strong>Become an Affiliate.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Launch Giveaway : </strong>To increase the organic reach for our products, we can introduce weekly giveaway of our products. These giveaway's shall have certain rules that will directly impact the virality of our products. You can have a look at one of the good case study of Kingsumo. <a href=\"https://sumo.com/stories/viral-giveaways\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://sumo.com/stories/viral-giveaways</a> . We use Kingsumo to create viral giveaway's .</li>\n<li>Promote and Run ads around multiple lead magnets. There are various lead magnets including - Ebook | Health Guide | Checklist | How to PDF's and so on. Let me put an example here. Here's an E Book on \"<strong>Nutrition as a part of Therapy in the treatment of Liver Disease</strong>\" . Now this Ebook will have useful content for the patient that shall include our products. Also, we run ads around this lead magnet to promote it and then build our sustainable email list. Two benefits we got - We sent out our product promotion to the prospect in terms of e book and we also have the prospect's email address.</li>\n<li>These lead magnets can be promoted FB, Insta, Google, Native Ads, Pinterest, Youtube Videos. This promotion can be organic and paid.</li>\n<li><strong>Launch Drip campaigns around email lists</strong> build from lead magnets. For example. In the above case, lead magnet was the ebook for Liver patients. So we have prospects to whom we can always followup regarding our products related to Liver. Or we can ask them to schedule a free appointment with our Nutritionist for better understanding on improving liver problems. Such drip campaigns focuses on sending series of emails on various parameters. These parameters can be Last email open or not, E Book downloaded or not, visited our landing page or not, Abandoned cart or not. Below  drip chart is an example of drip email series. We use our in-house built app called <strong><a href=\"http://sell3x.com\">Sell3x</a></strong> to perform email marketing automation.  Here's an example of a drip email campaign. <figure class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2549\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-md.jpeg 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-lg.jpeg 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"771\" height=\"658\"></figure></li>\n<li>Let us say we have got 1000 email subscribers from our lead magnet - <strong>Nutrition as a part of Therapy in the treatment of Liver Disease. </strong>Now we send out email campaigns as a drip series. Each email shall contain a link back to our landing page or store. This will have two impact - <strong>Sales or No sales</strong> from our E Com Store. If it's a sale, very good. If it's not a sale, we will put all this audience who clicked on the link and visited on our landing page on Facebook and Google re-marketing ad funnel. This ad funnel shall show ads to audience claiming 25% flat off on their first purchase.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Email Marketing</strong> </span>- Email marketing needs to be done for various process.- Asking Gym Trainers, Celebrities, Influencers, Food Bloggers, Nutritionist and others to join our Affiliate program and our outreach program.- Reaching out our prospects through email lists.- Emailing existing customers to buy again.The entire strategy will not be focused on just one marketing channel. We will leave no DM channel unturned and employ all the strategies in parallel so as to have aggressive promotion and sales in the process.</li>\n<li><strong>Remarketing Campaigns</strong> - There's a saying in internet marketing that it takes 7 attempts for a visitor to convert into a customer. This means that you have to get into the eyes of a prospect atleast 7 times so that he could make a decision. Re-marketing comes in here. We do this with the help of Facebook and Google Ads. If some one has visited your website once, you can make him visit your landing page / website / lead magnet or anything related by re-marketing him.\n<p> </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Concluding Notes</strong> -  </h3>\n<p>Digital Sales is a function of a optimised digital marketing process. And we at Editsoft Digital are highly inclined towards building the same process.</p>\n<p>Digital marketing is all about how creative you can be. And when it comes to be innovative about your approach, I am cent percent sure about how my team would execute the plan perfectly. So, in the end it matters about the execution only. There are a lot of places available over internet to find about new plans, ideas and promotional methods but the thing that owns the result is just the execution. Thus, my suggestion to have full focus on the implementation part and then take your project ahead.</p>\n<p>In any case, you feel like I becoming your digital partner or consultant in helping you take your business to a greater height, just let me know here - Contact Me</p>",
