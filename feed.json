It also offers various functions including customized funnel templates, membership, and split testing for landing pages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Thrive Themes Membership is a complete suite of conversion-focused WordPress themes and plugins and its tools and plugins range from page builders and marketing timers to landing page templates with A/B Testing tools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So, Simply we can say that ClickFunnels is basically used and designed for creating sales funnels to make your sales and marketing easy and Thrive Membership was the complete suite of marketing and sales which includes WordPress Plugins which make sure to run your marketing landing pages and marketing processes in an easy manner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And comparing <strong>Thrive Membership</strong> with ClickFunnels is like comparing Fruits with Vegetables. Both are helpful in creating optimized and conversion-optimized funnels with A/B Testing capabilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Thrive themes</strong> is not advertised for <strong>funnel building solution</strong> but funnels you will create with ClickFunnels can also be created with Thrive Themes and its plugins. Both platforms differ in their features, functionality, and price.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So, let’s start the comparison by providing the meaning of the term ‘funnel’.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A funnel is a process of converting leads towards a goad. Funnels can be anything like a set of pages and structured sequences.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Pricing Comparison of Thrive Themes and ClickFunnels</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Pricing of Thrive Membership</strong></span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/thrive-membership.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/thrive-membership-xs.png 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/thrive-membership-sm.png 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/thrive-membership-md.png 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/thrive-membership-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Thrive Membership\" width=\"245\" height=\"75\"></figure></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">$19/ month</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">($228/year)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unlimited Unique Visitors</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unlimited Funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unlimited Pages</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Up to 25 different sites</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Pricing of ClickFunnels (Basic)</strong></span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/ClickFunnels.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/ClickFunnels-xs.png 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/ClickFunnels-sm.png 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/ClickFunnels-md.png 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/ClickFunnels-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"ClickFunnels\" width=\"248\" height=\"74\"></figure></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">$97/month</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">(​$1,164/year)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Maximum 20K Visitors</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Maximum 20 Funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Maximum 100 Pages</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Pricing of ClickFunnels (Etision Suite)</strong></span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/ClickFunnels-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/ClickFunnels-2-xs.png 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/ClickFunnels-2-sm.png 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/ClickFunnels-2-md.png 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/37/responsive/ClickFunnels-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"ClickFunnels Etision Suite\" width=\"248\" height=\"74\"></figure></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">$297/month</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">($3,564/year)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unlimited Unique Visitors</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unlimited Funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unlimited Pages</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As you can see ClickFunnels standard is almost 5 times more expensive than the Thrive Membership.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So what you are paying for with ClickFunnels just to integrate all the funnel steps and processes within the one platform. <strong>ClickFunnels standard</strong> still requires you to integrate with other third-party programs to use email services and payment and you can configure them within the ClickFunnels dashboard as this is not an all in one software or solution, although Thrive Themes can easily integrate with all the tools needed to create a functioning funnel. With Thrive Themes you will need to go into the third party programs directly to integrate them with Thrive Themes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Let me explain the difference, for example if you are going to setup a payment page. After connecting your ClickFunnels account to the third party payment gateway such as Strip, you can create a payment page within your ClickFunnels dashboard. Which means you can create and edit your product details and order within the <strong>ClickFunnels Dashboard</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And, if you are using thrive themes, then you need to configure your checkout page within the stripe plugin of WordPress then you can link this to your checkout page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There is an all in one feature for ClickFunnels which includes its hosting too. With ClickFunnels your hosting of pages also included. With Thrive Themes you need a WordPress website which is hosted by yourself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And as the comparison of the price difference between both, getting your own hosting is not very expensive than buying ClickFunnels for that much cost.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Also the price difference between ClickFunnels standard and <strong>ClickFunnels Etison Elite</strong> is because Etison Elite includes its email autoresponder, CRM and affiliate management system which is very useful while you are running an online business.</span></p>\n<table style=\"width: 637px; height: 433px;\" width=\"574\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 71px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 216.505px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>General Features</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 165.049px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Thrive Themes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 134.951px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>ClickFunnels</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 119.417px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>CF Elite</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 10px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 216.505px; height: 10px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #236fa1;\"><strong>Unlimited Updates</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 165.049px; height: 10px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 134.951px; height: 10px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 119.417px; height: 10px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 45px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 216.505px; height: 45px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #236fa1;\"><strong>Unlimited Customer Support</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 165.049px; height: 45px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 134.951px; height: 45px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 119.417px; height: 45px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 71px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 216.505px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #236fa1;\"><strong>Product Tutorials</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 165.049px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 134.951px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 119.417px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 71px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 216.505px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #236fa1;\"><strong>14 Day Free Trial</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 165.049px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong>No</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 134.951px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 119.417px; height: 71px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 98px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 216.505px; height: 98px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #236fa1;\"><strong>30 Day Money Back Guarantee</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 165.049px; height: 98px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 134.951px; height: 98px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 119.417px; height: 98px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Features Comparison as per their plans</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>ClickFunnels and Thrive Themes</strong> both have awesome customer support.

Because people will forget to look at your website.</p>\n<h3><strong>Leadpages Integrations</strong></h3>\n<p>Here is the list of all the integrations provided by Leadpages:</p>\n<h4><strong>Email Integrations Supported by Leadpages</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1ShoppingCart</li>\n<li>ActiveCampaign</li>\n<li>AWeber</li>\n<li>ConstantContact</li>\n<li>Drip</li>\n<li>Emma</li>\n<li>GetResponse</li>\n<li>GoToWebinar</li>\n<li>Hubspot</li>\n<li>iContact</li>\n<li>InfusionSoft</li>\n<li>Interspire</li>\n<li>MadMimi</li>\n<li>Marketo</li>\n<li>MailChimp</li>\n<li>OfficeAutoPilot</li>\n<li>Salesforce</li>\n<li>SendReach</li>\n<li>WebinarJam</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Leadpages Support &amp; Community</strong></h3>\n<p>Leadpages run various training webinars frequently with the aim of helping you to get more. Also, you can get more help from their active blogs, collection of marketing resources, and knowledge base. But they can’t provide chat on their site, chat feature is only available inside the Leadpage app for Pro and advanced members.</p>\n<h3><strong>Pricing offered by Leadpages</strong></h3>\n<p>Leadpages offered three-tiered pricing plans which are Standard, Pro, and advanced.</p>\n<p>Also, you can choose a month to month billing for standard and Pro plan. The advanced plan requires an annual or two-year payment upfront. You will save quite a bit more if you will pay for annual and especially for a two-year service in which pricing is cut off in half as compared to monthly billing.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Plan</strong></p>\n<p>In this plan, you have to pay $17 per month when you purchase two years upfront, $25 per month when you will purchase annually, and $37 for a month to month plan. Month to month is still in your budget if you will get such great features inside in comparison with ClickFunnels.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Plan</strong></p>\n<p>In this plan, you need to pay $42 per month when you purchase for two years, $48 per month when you will purchase annually and $79 for a month to month plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Plan</strong></p>\n<p>This plan does not offer month to month plan. For annual billing you need to pay $199 per month and for two year purchase, you need to pay $159 per month.</p>\n<h3><strong>ClickFunnels Vs. Leadpages</strong></h3>\n<p>There a various factors that I personally believe most people will look at price and ease of use.</p>\n<p>When you will see for price compatibility then Leadpages is the winner here. It is a bit cheaper than ClickFunnels.</p>\n<p>There is a reason why Leadpages is much cheaper than ClickFunnels like Leadpages are not that much convenient than ClickFunnels.</p>\n<p>You don’t need a separate web host or a seperate email marketing or shopping cart solution. Also you don’t need a seperate affiliate program. Everything is included in just one package.</p>\n<p>If you are looking at this way then ClickFunnels is very budget friendly in its own right. But, I do think Leadpages is an awesome choice in some situations. If you want to create landing pages much quickly without more customization then Leadpages is a greap platform for you.</p>\n<p>So, which should you choose?</p>\n<p>Go with <span style=\"color: #236fa1;\">Leadpages</span> if you want a budget marketing software that can get the job done. You can create beautiful sales pages without knowing a bit of codes.</p>\n<p>Go with <span style=\"color: #236fa1;\">ClickFunnels</span> if you want to create an effective conversion optimized funnel pages without learning HTML.</p>\n<p>Go with <span style=\"color: #236fa1;\">Leadpages</span> if you simply want to design landing pages with a simple one-step landing page.</p>\n<p>Go with <span style=\"color: #236fa1;\">ClickFunnels</span> if you don’t want to use different systems for marketing program. You will save much time with an all in one solution.</p>\n<p>Go with <span style=\"color: #236fa1;\">ClickFunnels</span>, if you want to create an funnel with multiple pages along with the flexibility to rearrange the pages in your funnel.</p>\n<h6>Conclusion</h6>\n<p>I love to use both ClickFunnels and Leadpages, and I think both are great tools for converting leads. You can only build pages on Leadpages but you can build pages and build funnels as well on ClickFunnels. The right choice for you will mainly depend on what you need from a marketing tool. But if you are still not confirmed about which one to use then you should try 14 days free trial of ClickFunnels and test all features. If you find that is not good for your business then cancel and check out Leadpages. I am about 90% sure that ClickFunnels will do everything you want.</p>",

While you are building complex pages and websites which involve hundreds of user actions. If an editor is a few seconds slower on any step, then it can turn to frustrating hours.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Thrive Membership Ease of Use</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If you are new to WordPress then you have various things to learn and build your online business and generate more leads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When you will get to know everything about drag and drop editor, then it’s not just simple and fast to use but very powerful also and takes you to feel of designer level customization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Thrive has a huge knowledge base of training content and also there are new features you can expect blog posts and various learning videos to explain its features and how to use them in a very easier manner.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>LeadPages Pro Ease of Use</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Standard templates or LeadPages Pro are designed for quick development only allows you to swap some key elements for your industry before publishing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Hence, once you are ready to use it then you can use it with just some clicks on what you want to edit and then edit it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Also, their drag-and-drop editor also much more useful than the standard template editor but is not very flexible means you can drag-and-drop elements on the landing page but when you want to move page sections requires drag-and-dropping from the sidebar menu then you need their draggable columns to create width layouts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">However, LeadPages also has an extensive knowledge base, and also you can choose from some great tutorials and webinars which teach you how to use their features and take advantage of the product.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>User Support Comparison of LeadPages Pro and Thrive Membership</strong></span></h3>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>User Support in Thrive Membership</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If you have purchased Thrive Membership then you will also get unlimited access to their support team till that time when you are a member. If you will purchase a single <strong>Thrive Product</strong> then you will get access to one year of unlimited support and if you will need help after that one year then you can also extend your support term with a small fee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The support team is very fast and <strong>extremely knowledgeable</strong>. Just you need to do is log in to the support forum and post a ticket and you will get a response on the same day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As my personal experience, there is a rare case they can’t solve your issue through the ticket then they can log in to your website if you want and fix it for you with security.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>User Support in LeadPages Pro</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When you have purchased a LeadPages membership, then your support level depends on your subscription plan. At the basic plan, you have access to the knowledge base, and also you can submit support tickets from your account dashboard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At the Pro Level you will get access to personal support chat which is available for you from Monday to Friday from 9 am to 5 pm and also you can able to submit support tickets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At the Expertise level, you can submit support tickets, use live chat, and also you can get live phone support which is available for Monday to Friday from 9 am to 5 pm CST.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Overall Comparision Of Both (LeadPages and Thrive Membership</strong></span></h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>LeadPages Pro</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">LeadPages can be a great option for you if you don’t have a website based on WordPress CMS  because it allows you to host your landing pages on its own servers. However, this also means that you can’t own your pages so if you will cancel your subscription then all of your pages are lost.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There are also some cool and amazing features like:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">LeadDigits</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Facebook Integration</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">LeadLinks</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">For the Complete Feature overview, you can get it from <strong><a href=\"https://ankit.digital/leadpages-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #000000;\">here</a></strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>LeadPages Pro</strong> is just more than double the price of Thrive Membership ($588/Year vs $228/year), so if pricing is a concern for you then there is a large gap between the two, even they are capable of doing the same things.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Thrive Membership</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Thrive Membership can be an amazing solution for boosting the conversion of your website if your website is on WordPress and you can own your pages after your membership canceled also.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Thrive membership also gives you access to all of Thrive’s current and upcoming plugins and themes. Which includes the content builder from which you can do complete drag-and-drop customization with zero designing skills for any and all the pages you own, forms, and blog posts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When you will integrate with the Thrive leads plugin then you will get that functionality that can give you a better response than LeadPages with a few different features.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This also includes reporting tools for content marketing so you can fully get reports on what works with your audience and brings in the most leads as well as options to automatically target and offers to different visitors segments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And also you can get its membership for just payment of $228/year which is much lesser than LeadPages. You can get access to every product created by Thrive, all upcoming updates, lifetime support, and if <strong>Thrive Price</strong> increased then you don’t need to pay extra in the membership period.</span></p>",

There is always a need improvement in many cases as we have pointed all pros and cons we have experienced while using the platform.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Unbounce Pros</strong></span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You can build and publish landing pages very quickly.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You can easily create variants for testing.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Excellent templates and various third party sources for more templates.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Highly Customizable.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Awesome Landing page builder.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Split testing functions are very good.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Unbounce Cons</strong></span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Form builder of Unbounce lacks some key features.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You can’t do a split test for your existing landing pages created outside of Unbounce.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You can’t add custom classes to buttons in Unbounce which prevents tracking goals.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If Unbounce let you do split test the landing pages built outside the Unbounce then this would be a great win and the ability to add custom classes to buttons can save a lot of time as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But overall, Unbounce can save you more time than it costs and once you are running with this platform then you can do things easily. The landing page builder is great and the templates available are excellent and you can also get the freedom to customize your landing pages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Also, I must include the split testing feature which is solid and too sure that they are not extensive as a dedicated piece of <strong>A/B testing software</strong> but it is a strong offering for a landing page builder and also you can get more features than most of the alternatives.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Unbounce features: More than a landing page builder</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As I have already explained above that Unbounce is a landing page builder primarily so the platform offers a set of features beyond its builder and many of these are very important when it comes to create and optimize landing pages like A/B Testing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here is the list of features offered by Unbounce:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Landing pages</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Popups &amp; sticky bars</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A/B testing</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Reports &amp; analytics</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Dynamic Text Replacement</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Smart Traffic</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">AMP landing pages</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Lead form builder</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Let us explain every feature:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Landing Pages Builder of UnBounce</strong>:</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">With <strong>Unbounce Drag and drop</strong>, landing page builder can make sure anyone anytime can pick up the tool and start creating pages without any coding knowledge or using any designing software.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/34/Landing-Pages-Builder-of-UnBounce.gif\" alt=\"Landing Pages Builder of UnBounce\" width=\"606\" height=\"560\"></figure></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You can choose from a lot of templates to get started and customize them to meet your needs easily and quickly.

And also this feature included in a landing page builder.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/34/Lead-Form-Builder-Unbounce.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/34/responsive/Lead-Form-Builder-Unbounce-xs.png 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/34/responsive/Lead-Form-Builder-Unbounce-sm.png 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/34/responsive/Lead-Form-Builder-Unbounce-md.png 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/34/responsive/Lead-Form-Builder-Unbounce-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Lead Form Builder Unbounce\" width=\"713\" height=\"335\"></figure></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You will get better results from a form builder and optimization tool that operates. And this is the area where you really need a specialist toll to maximise conversions. It also helps in integration of <strong>Leadformly with unbounce</strong> so you can embed your forms on landing pages and also any other web page outside of Unbounce.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>How much does Unbounce cost?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unbounce has three core plans and you can get access to most of its features across all of them.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Essential: $79/month</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Premium: $159/month</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Enterprise: $399+/month</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As you can see here, pricing starts from $79 per month and the difference is how many landing pages and popups you can create. Even on the essential plan you will get a limit of 75 landing pages and eight popups or sticky bars, which will be all needed by all some smaller businesses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Also, the essential plan doesn’t support AMP landing pages or some of the more advanced targeting settings. There are some features reserved for the enterprise plan such as audit logs, dedicated support and also page migration.</span></p>\n<h6><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Final Words</strong></span></h6>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unbounce is a great tool for building landing pages to promote your products and increase the conversion rates many times and also there is various features you will never see in other platforms as Unbounce itself mainly a landing page builder so we can’t say it is bad, above review written by using and experienced about its features itself.</span></p>",

I am making this review on the basis of my own experience using ClickFunnels’ startup plan which itself includes coreClickFunnels features and other special and unique features.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>ClickFunnels Review Highlights</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here is a list of ClickFunnels’ review highlights on which we are going to know more in this review:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickFunnels is a nice landing page builder, with an easy drag and drop editor.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Very Easy and various integrations that allow you to capture emails and take payments inside the ClickFunnels.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Built with A/B Testing capabilities.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Easy to learn and use.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Focused on making its users more money.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">They offer a free trial of two weeks.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/ClickFunnels-Review-Highlights.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/ClickFunnels-Review-Highlights-xs.jpg 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/ClickFunnels-Review-Highlights-sm.jpg 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/ClickFunnels-Review-Highlights-md.jpg 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/ClickFunnels-Review-Highlights-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"ClickFunnels Review Highlights\" width=\"723\" height=\"379\"></figure></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What is ClickFunnels?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Clickfunnels started in 2014, but in just 3 years it’s been in the words of Forbes, “silently revolutionizing the online marketing industry.” With ClickFunnels, it makes you easier for businesses and entrepreneurs to sell online using this with the ease of complicated marketing technology, which is called sales funnels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Clickfunnels Founded by Russell Brunson who is as famous as his creation, and for a good reason. He’s made a fortune not just only for ClickFunnels, but other marketing adventures. He played around with email marketing and eventually began to master sales funnels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickFunnels started out as a way to help Brunson and his team to create funnels more quickly for different ventures as usually, it takes over a week or more to develop funnels. So they realized their creation can be useful to others and then they have launched ClickFunnels as its name means just <strong>click and make your funnels</strong> it works also in just some steps only.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What Are Funnels? How Sales Funnels Work?</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In digital marketing, it is a process that can take people who don’t know you and convert them as your customers, which is known as a marketing funnel. In e-commerce, sales funnel is a series of steps designed to guide visitors to the checkout page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Step1:</strong> Imagine a funnel.</span><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Step2:</strong> Imagine this funnel will be helpful for your website visitors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Your site visitors are looking around by checking things out. And with a sales funnel you can get your website visitors to the right place for what they actually want to purchase.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickFunnels is created to save your time and energy like if you want to create funnels for yourself and develop it for yourself then it requires a lot of technological proficiency and also maybe some other third-party applications, so it this respect ClickFunnels Succeeds.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What ClickFunnels can do for you?</strong></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Pros of ClickFunnels</strong></span></h3>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Makes you money</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">One of the best things about ClickFunnels is its focus on making money for its users. They make it very easy to use and make your account and put your content and start taking payments. But maybe it can take some hours to figure out most of what you need.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Drag and Drop Page Builder</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There are very few features that are very useful here. I really like how easy it is to duplicate pages and the fact is I can save templates to use them later again. Their page builder is a very important feature, and they have pulled it off. When you get used to it, it is an easy to use drag and drop page builder.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>A/B Testing</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">With ClickFunnels you will get a free A/B testing tool which is great itself to test your landing pages on various platforms also. All you need to do is duplicate a page and make your changes and choose the traffic you want to see version A or B.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Various Selection of Integrations</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickFunnels handles API Integrations well. Email and payment processors are not too good but they are working reliably and are easier to manage.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>WordPress Integration Plugin</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You will also get a WordPress plugin that can let you add ClickFunnels pages to your WordPress website and use it for your marketing. It saves a lot of time and is less than working between ClickFunnels and WordPress without a plugin. The ClickFunnels WordPress Plugin is also rated about 4.4 stars in WordPress Plugin store and has about 20k active installations.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>All in one</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">From ClickFunnels you can build your landing pages, create various forms and order forms, and send marketing emails all from one platform. All of this really does save your time and money, various resources you would otherwise need to spend on many developers, CSS, hosting configurations, and more.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Reasonable Value</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If you have more than 20000 visitors and need over 100 pages then ClickFunnels Platinum might not be too much.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickFunnels is not perfect but it does a great job of packaging great tools together and making them accessible.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Cons of ClickFunnels</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I have some bad news, not much but still, there are few areas that need to work on ClickFunnels. Our review can’t be completed without looking at the ugly side as well.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Overpriced?</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A very small drawback is the price. There are only three pricing options like $97/month, $297/month, and $2,497/month. In this tool, this is not a big deal just another investment in your business, and as I have said above you will get a good package for it.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Customer Service</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Customer support is good but in my experience, they have been fine with a basic question but if you will ask them more difficult things especially about more advanced features they can’t be very helpful.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Too </strong><span style=\"font-size: 18.3848px;\">Templates</span></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This one is not on ClickFunnels but more on the community. While you have the ability to customize with ClickFunnels, many people use similar designs. By considering the popularity of ClickFunnels, this has to be a large amount of ClickFunnels looks good.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Bugs</strong></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickFunnels will go down or experience some errors. This doesn’t happen any time but it does. If you are investing a lot in advertising and driving traffic to your funnels and a ClickFunnels glitch brings your pages down for even a few hours you can lose a lot of money.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>ClickFunnels Pricing – How much is Clickfunnels?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickFunnels have two plans which are ClickFunnels Standard Plan and their ClickFunnels Platinum Plan. ClickFunnels is $97 per month and Platinum comes in at $297 per month. And if you want to try all its features you will get a 14 days free trial to try their services, so at the end you don’t need to commit to an expensive plan. If you will pay annually instead of monthly then you will get two months free in $997 for ClickFunnels and $2997 for platinum plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If you will compare ClickFunnels with LeadPages, a similar service which starts at $25 per month but it is important to keep in mind about ClickFunnels main service is to create funnels for you with more efficiency and it does a good job in this. I can consider it a good investment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The main difference between an entry level account and a premium account are :</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The standard plan gets the main service the funnel builder with various limitations on the amount of pages, visits and custom domains which is only 3 and only some of the full list features.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But both the plans have unlimited contacts, unlimited members can be added and all the advanced funnels, A/B Split tests and a few other features which can be helpful to create your own  sales funnels.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What is FunnelFlix?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickFunnels Founder, originally made a lot of his money by selling information products and online courses. It seems that ClickFunnels is trying to launch the NetFlix model with FunnelFlix but with online courses, in my opinion is confusing when you are just trying to use the software for marketing services. There is some good content but it is just too much.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Features Overview of ClickFunnels</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here’s the full list of StartUp features:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">20 funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">100 pages</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">20,000 visitors</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">unlimited contacts</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">3 custom domains</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A/B split tests</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Email integrations</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Optin funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickPops</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickOptin</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">All advanced funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sales funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Membership funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unlimited members</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Auto webinar funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Hangout funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Order pages</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Upsell pages</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Downsale pages</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Share your funnels</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">1 SMTP integration</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">1 billing integration per type</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>ClickFunnels Page Builder</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We can say this is the main feature of ClickFunnels, so I would like to devote special attention to it. ClickFunnels have a solid landing page builder. ClickFunnels distances itself from page building software and advertises its funnel creating software but its landing page builder is also very easy to use and it includes various elements which can convert customers for you easily.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/clickfunnels-templates.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/clickfunnels-templates-xs.png 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/clickfunnels-templates-sm.png 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/clickfunnels-templates-md.png 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/clickfunnels-templates-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"clickfunnels templates\" width=\"714\" height=\"363\"></figure>You can also save various templates and make personal page templates and it's very easy to find them, as you can see toggle with basic settings and you can open them in the editor.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/ClickFunnels-Editor.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/ClickFunnels-Editor-xs.png 300w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/ClickFunnels-Editor-sm.png 480w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/ClickFunnels-Editor-md.png 768w ,https://ankit.digital/media/posts/33/responsive/ClickFunnels-Editor-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"ClickFunnels Editor\" width=\"703\" height=\"353\"></figure></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Once you will open your pages in the editor, you will basically now go to work with a drag and drop builder. It is complicated but not more than other page builders but still it can be easier to use.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>ClickFunnels Integrations</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ClickFunnels has very few partners you can add to your integrations quickly.

I am doing email marketing for years and I have almost used all the top notch apps available in the market be it Mailchimp, Getresponse, Sendgrid, Mailgun, and many others. But there’s very strong feeling in you when you take control of your email marketing. On my hunt for perfect email marketing solution I got to know about Amazon SES. It’s part of AWS. With Amazon SES, you can widely operate not only for email marketing but also for various for marketing automation, triggering various kind of rules for emails and much more. Plus point of having this control is that you can do many things in cost efficient manner. With Amazon SES, your cost for sending 1000 emails is just $0.10.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Upside of using Amazon SES is just not being a cost efficient solution but also higher inbox delivery rates (Comm’on, we are talking about Amazon Servers). You can use SES to build your email marketing process the way you want. To do that, you need to either code your own application or fins some reliable hosted app that can act as your email client.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now, this is where sendy comes in. You simply need to integrate Sendy with your Amazon SES account and then you are done.
