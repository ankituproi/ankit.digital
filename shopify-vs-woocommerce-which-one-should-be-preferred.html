And the news you would like to know right now is that you can accomplish it at your own without any outside help of a proffessional designer .We’ll be discussing it later .</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There might be many questions or you might be wondering ton things like which one should I opt for? Which is going to fit in my specific needs better is it shopify or WooCommerce of course we are here talking about developing an online shop.Which has more features?Which one is costlier? Flexibility .. features provided by both of them ..</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know this is lot to take in at single time ,but as me proceed further you might get answers to all of the questions mentioned above and all of them in  depth .You will unveil the one platform you want according to your needs and requirements of your e-Commerce store.</span></p><p><b>Shopify vs WooCommerce</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.)</span><b>Design:-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design is whole sole of the eCommerce store. Site is not trusted by users until it functions well and has right aesthetics as well.</span></p><p><b>Shopify’s Design-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality of visual themes provided by Shopify are its best selling points.The templates available for you on shopify are more than hundreds and more than twenty of them are available in free . All of them available on Shopify are mobile responsive which is its best part and varying color options are available as well.Aesthetics of these templates are clean and are fashionable sleek which makes it well suited for modern thinking websites.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Templates provided by shopify are designed by creative outsourced web designers. Since it is not a in house creation they are ensured to be up to date and very engaging .</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the pricing for some of the templates might go as high as two hundred dollars per template but after spending you will feel the template worthy of the price.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t panic as I mentioned above there are wide variety of free options available as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Shopify’s attractive designs catches many eyes and in result sometimes users who used Shopify to create their webpage complain of its similarity with other sites. So Shopify also provides you with easy methods of chopping and changing .This is the reason behind the encouragement of customization.You can change the style or color or both with ease ,where on the other hand many proffessional designers can use the specialized ‘Liquid’ Language of this platform to make it creative and completely seperate a brand’s look .</span></p><p><b>WooCommerce Design-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many different features of WooCommerce when we come to talk about its designs ,then you have to invest some hours and will discover that world is your oyster.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers of WooThemes created the WooCommerce plugin and is acquired by Automattic. It is not the platform for delivery of particular design traits . It just offers you the way to sell products or a service online . The designing part is dependent on the WordPress theme you have currently .</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore it can be said that WooCommerce is created to cooperate with varying themes in the market but condition applied is they should follow standard recommendations and hours of practice.It implies that in maximum cases you can choose any WordPress theme according to your choice and integrate it with WooCommerce.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provided with the above mentioned themes you can also find some themes specially built for WooCommerce to create your service or product option list look eye catchy.Woo’s default theme called Storefront which is available for free , is the best design to begin with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is creative theme which was designed by keeping all the features of an efficient eCommerce store in mind and in result help you sell your product with ease.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are child themes for Storefront also available for those who want to modify the look of their store further. Some of the themes are also available in variety of range i.e from as low as 39$ per piece and can go only high up to 120$. But as it is said ‘Money well spent’ or worthy of the price tag.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a wide range of WooCommerce themes ,you can always switch to ThemeForest where WooCommerce compatible themes are available in hundreds in number.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When comparison has its basis on design ,definitely WooCommerce stands way ahead of SHopify .It is clear from above stated fact that apart from WooCommerce themes , you can also use any of the WordPress themes to work with your platform and definitely you can find hundreds of thousands of them on web.</span></p><p><b>2.)Comparison on Money basis (Price)-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two really  have very different approach towards pricing. And under this basis Shopify wins as its pricing strategy is quite clear and straightforward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce although being available for free or in one word said as open source software. It is easily downloadable from WordPress.org in free atleast but once you go for actually launching an eCommerce working store you should ready with your wallets to spend some penny for it.(You’ll unveils the details in a while)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it in simple words ,when you work with Shopify, you can relate it to single out of the box solution available with a one time price tag . Once you open the box , you are good to go with the latest new eCommerce store since all your requirements are included in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summing up the above mentioned details we can conclude it into :</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce store by Shopify implementing a top level domain :29.75$ per month.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce store by WooCommerce implementing on same setup:$29 per month .</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce claims to be available at free of cost and although its software is available at free of cost but if you want to run your Ecommerce store it costs approximately same as Shopify.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expenditures on WooCommerce do not end up just here as you have to also spend some from your wallet on SEO,Payment gateways and many more features. These extensions may be all one time payment but are usually around $49-$79</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final line of all above discussion is WooCommerce is comparatively cheaper but with every extended features you have to exchange dollars .You have to be careful while setting up that you dont go over your budget line.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also transaction fees to explain this further, whenever anything from your site sells i.e for processing payment or delivering money to your account they charge you money. Usually it is around 3-4% per transaction and it changes quite often but confirm the details before signing up a deal with either of these platforms .</span></p><p><b>3.) Comparison of the basis of Features:-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although both platforms have completely different point of view towards pricing but when it comes to features, the are both approximately similar.</span></p><p><b>Shopify-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify presents you with lots of free options, from the very beginning it allows you to have :</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Products are unlimited</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage of file is unlimited</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud analysis is automatic</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog modules</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discount codes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSL certificate is absolutely free</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML and CSS are purely editable</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments through credit card</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varying language options</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profiles of customers</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media combination</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both physical as well as digital products in store</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic is unlimited</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup regular</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site stat and report of product</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Print orders</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipping options</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As compared to WooCOmmerce where feature as shipping options, CSV uploads or fb selling will set you back up to five hundred to six hundred dollars to even get started Shopify provides all these completely free of cost.</span></p><p><b>Shopify:-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a complete out-of-the-box solution and subsciption based.It can be used both online and offline as well. It also provides you with 24*7 chat and email support.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your store can be modified to an extent allowed by Shopify i.e it is a closed platform and it also controls your web data. The designs made available to you are in hundreds in number out of which more than twenty are available at totally free of cost. They make you available with free domain with every plan. File storage is also unlimited It also has a native support for various languages.</span></p><p><b>WooCommerce:-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a plugin by Wordpress which is absolutely free. All it needs to get started is a server and WordPress working installation to run.It only works online and has ticket as well as forum support. Different from Shopify ,it is an open source which in simple words implies you can freely modify your store without any boundations. Unlike Shopify the subdomain is not included within it and also the storage of file is limited. It also accepts various different languages via third party plugins.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it is evident from above mentioned comparison that none of the important features are missing from either of the platforms. While choosing one platform all you need to concentrate on, is your personal need or your need of an open or close platform.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally while evaluating both platforms on the basis of their features I somewhere felt that Shopify was a little ahead of WooCommerce as Shopify is laser-focused solution and easy to handle as well. But on the other hand WooCommerce is extremely feature rich. We can conclude that winner on the basis of features can not be decided as they both have their equal positives and negatives as well . All depends on your and your site’s personal need .</span></p><p><b>4.) Usability (ease)-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So according to above points we didn’t have our winners so maybe this is a point where we can compare them . The point states the ease with which a working eCommerce store can be setup by using any of them.</span></p><p><b>Shopify-</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well in my personal opinion, when it comes to an ease with which you can set up shopify’s strength lies within this. Since it is a subscription based tool, which if simply put in words implies that you just have to visit Shopify.com and sign up. Go through their process of setup and you are all good to go</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very user friendly and guides you all the way by helping you setup via asking you type of your store and relatively suggesting you a type of design well suited for your store.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t require any professional skills to develop your site. The process is itself very straightforward. All the important features of it can be accessed later, just after you have your store running.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify is an intuitive solution and there are no unexpected interruption . which means you can simply set up your store just by signing-in.</span></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 24, 2020</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ankit.digital/e-commerce/">E Commerce</a></li><li><a href="https://ankit.digital/reviews/">Reviews</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/word-ai-review-or-honest-review-with-all-pros-and-cons.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Word Ai Review | Honest Review with all Pros and Cons</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://ankit.digital/employee-circle-grid.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Employee Circle Grid</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ankit.digital/authors/ankit-sharma/" class="inverse" title="Ankit Sharma">Ankit Sharma</a></h3></div></div><div class="post__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankit.digital/honest-shopify-review-is-it-really-the-best-ecommerce-platform.html" class="inverse">Honest Shopify Review: Is it really the best eCommerce Platform?</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-18T19:32">September 18, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://ankit.digital/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://ankit.digital/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=16be857f09f55a0c76ea5e92e1f5f9d0"></script></body></html>
