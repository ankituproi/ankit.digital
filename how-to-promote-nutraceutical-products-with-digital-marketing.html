And I will uncover them all in this blog post. When it comes to promoting nutra products it is important to choose your promotion methods accurately and these methods are valid even if you are a seller or if you are the manufacturer. This blog post will also cover digital marketing for nutracuitical products and company.</p><p>I would be very precise and calculative in explaining my process based approach. Sales in ecom industry is a function of good process. So we have to implement all the digital marketing strategies in order to complement good process that can ultimately build unlimited sales funnel. Let's begin step by step.</p><h2>Digital Strategy to Sell Nutraceutical products with digital marketing</h2><ol><li>Building an online E Com Store is very important if you want to have good sales without being dependent on third party platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and others. We recommend building this store using Shopify due to the responsive features of shopify and having it's adaptability in scaling the store as much as we wish to. <strong>We are shopify partners in India and so we can also help in store building part</strong>, if not developed already.</li><li>Influencers Outreach. To have better marketing of our products via social media and other mediums, we need to reach out to influencers and experts in the industry and collaborate with them to promote our products. These influencers can be - <strong>Health Experts | Health Bloggers | Food Bloggers | Gym Trainers | Nutritionist | Fitness Freaks and many more</strong>.</li><li>Influencer outreach program can be further categorised in two models - <strong>Pay Per Post</strong> and <strong>Become an Affiliate.</strong></li><li><strong>Launch Giveaway : </strong>To increase the organic reach for our products, we can introduce weekly giveaway of our products. These giveaway's shall have certain rules that will directly impact the virality of our products. You can have a look at one of the good case study of Kingsumo. <a href="https://sumo.com/stories/viral-giveaways" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sumo.com/stories/viral-giveaways</a> . We use Kingsumo to create viral giveaway's .</li><li>Promote and Run ads around multiple lead magnets. There are various lead magnets including - Ebook | Health Guide | Checklist | How to PDF's and so on. Let me put an example here. Here's an E Book on "<strong>Nutrition as a part of Therapy in the treatment of Liver Disease</strong>" . Now this Ebook will have useful content for the patient that shall include our products. Also, we run ads around this lead magnet to promote it and then build our sustainable email list. Two benefits we got - We sent out our product promotion to the prospect in terms of e book and we also have the prospect's email address.</li><li>These lead magnets can be promoted FB, Insta, Google, Native Ads, Pinterest, Youtube Videos. This promotion can be organic and paid.</li><li><strong>Launch Drip campaigns around email lists</strong> build from lead magnets. For example. In the above case, lead magnet was the ebook for Liver patients. So we have prospects to whom we can always followup regarding our products related to Liver. Or we can ask them to schedule a free appointment with our Nutritionist for better understanding on improving liver problems. Such drip campaigns focuses on sending series of emails on various parameters. These parameters can be Last email open or not, E Book downloaded or not, visited our landing page or not, Abandoned cart or not. Below  drip chart is an example of drip email series. We use our in-house built app called <strong><a href="http://sell3x.com">Sell3x</a></strong> to perform email marketing automation.  Here's an example of a drip email campaign.<figure class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2549"><img class="lazyload" src="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-xs.jpeg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-md.jpeg 768w ,https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/media/posts/24/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-02-at-11.57.05-PM-lg.jpeg 1024w" alt="" width="771" height="658"></figure></li><li>Let us say we have got 1000 email subscribers from our lead magnet - <strong>Nutrition as a part of Therapy in the treatment of Liver Disease. </strong>Now we send out email campaigns as a drip series. Each email shall contain a link back to our landing page or store. This will have two impact - <strong>Sales or No sales</strong> from our E Com Store. If it's a sale, very good. If it's not a sale, we will put all this audience who clicked on the link and visited on our landing page on Facebook and Google re-marketing ad funnel. This ad funnel shall show ads to audience claiming 25% flat off on their first purchase.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Email Marketing</strong> </span>- Email marketing needs to be done for various process.- Asking Gym Trainers, Celebrities, Influencers, Food Bloggers, Nutritionist and others to join our Affiliate program and our outreach program.- Reaching out our prospects through email lists.- Emailing existing customers to buy again.The entire strategy will not be focused on just one marketing channel. We will leave no DM channel unturned and employ all the strategies in parallel so as to have aggressive promotion and sales in the process.<strong>Concluding Notes</strong> -  Digital Sales is a function of a optimised digital marketing process. And we at Editsoft Digital are highly inclined towards building the same process.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Remarketing Campaigns</strong></span> - There's a saying in internet marketing that it takes 7 attempts for a visitor to convert into a customer. This means that you have to get into the eyes of a prospect atleast 7 times so that he could make a decision. Re-marketing comes in here. We do this with the help of Facebook and Google Ads. If some one has visited your website once, you can make him visit your landing page / website / lead magnet or anything related by re-marketing him.</li></ol><p>While I was preparing these strategies, I prepared some notes and on the basis of those notes, I was able to describe the strategy above. Although, there are few things that might bring more clarity when you see those notes. Have a look below.</p><p>[gallery ids="2551,2552,2553,2554"]</p><p>Digital marketing is all about how creative you can be. And when it comes to be innovative about your approach, I am cent percent sure about how my team would execute the plan perfectly. So, in the end it matters about the execution only. There are a lot of places available over internet to find about new plans, ideas and promotional methods but the thing that owns the result is just the execution. Thus, my suggestion to have full focus on the implementation part and then take your project ahead.</p><p>In any case, you feel like I becoming your digital partner or consultant in helping you take your business to a greater height, just let me know here - Contact Me</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 24, 2020</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/digital-marketing/">Digital Marketing</a></li><li><a href="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/strategy/">Strategy</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/long-tail-pro-review.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Long Tail Pro Review</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/let-facebook-chatbot-handle-your-sales-and-marketing-or-messenger-marketing-automation.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Let Facebook Chatbot handle your Sales and Marketing | Messenger Marketing Automation</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/authors/ankit-sharma/" class="inverse" title="Ankit Sharma">Ankit Sharma</a></h3></div></div><div class="post__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/best-email-marketing-alternatives-to-mailchimp.html" class="inverse">Best email marketing alternatives to Mailchimp</a></h4><time datetime="2020-04-14T14:45">April 14, 2020</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/word-ai-review-or-honest-review-with-all-pros-and-cons.html" class="inverse">Word Ai Review | Honest Review with all Pros and Cons</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-13T09:32">August 13, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://ankituproi.github.io/ankit.digital/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=16be857f09f55a0c76ea5e92e1f5f9d0"></script></body></html>
